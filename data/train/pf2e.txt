<|startoftext|>Describe a Aapoph Serpentfolk.
Aapophs possess greater strength and stronger venom than their zyss kin, but they lack zyss' intelligence and innate magic. Unlike their selfish superiors, aapophs are communal and group together to hunt, wrestle, and sleep curled together in pits. Though they're looked down upon and insulted by zyss, most aapophs lack the higher brain functions to recognize when they're being insulted, much less plan or execute a rebellion. Aapophs often have unusual physical mutations—horns, vestigial tails, or spines protruding from their scales—yet these variations have little impact on their overall combat prowess— and combat prowess is the measure by which zyss judge them.
Today, the central realm of the Darklands retains the old name of the serpentfolk empire that once dominated this region—Sekamina. This name is also the source of the serpentfolk’s Aklo title, sekmin, which they are often called in ancient texts. Sekamina itself retains very little of the serpentfolk’s legacy, its mantle of rule having passed on to others like drow, ghouls, gugs, and deep gnomes. Yet in remote reaches of this dangerous realm, the ruins of serpentfolk cities still stand. Within, a great many serpentfolk sleep in torpor in secluded vaults, with only a few cells awake to enact their schemes. In addition, a small number of serpentfolk settlements dot Golarion’s surface, most of them in humid, remote jungles, far-flung islands, or caverns close to the surface. It’s rare for such a settlement to number more than a few dozen serpentfolk. They rely primarily on slaves to build their power bases, to defend them, and to perform essentially all the practical functions of their society. This includes providing food, crafting goods, and tending to the serpentfolk’s every need.
Zyss serpentfolk are megalomaniacal geniuses with dreams of returning to their place of dominance, though modern serpentfolk have few means of accomplishing this goal. Many of their plans hinge on resurrecting Ydersius, their decapitated god. His headless body still thrashes about, mindless, in the Darklands, waiting to be reunited with his lost skull. Serpentfolk numbers are so small that reclaiming their dominance seems a distant dream, especially since their reproduction is slow. Though a parent can birth a dozen young at once, the gestation period lasts up to a decade, and the likelihood that even one will be zyss is low. There’s no telling whether a child will be zyss or aapoph, regardless of parentage. A coveted zyss child is just as likely to arise from aapoph parents as from two zyss, and every serpentfolk colony has someone in charge of sorting the young, identifying the earliest signs of intelligence in them.
Though the number of zyss is small in serpentfolk colonies, bringing in more zyss isn’t necessarily desirable. A serpentfolk conclave with just a few zyss is functional, but one with a large number becomes fractious. Cults and societies form, all pursuing their own passions and politics, with scheming and backstabbing running rampant. A powerful priest may be able to bring other zyss to heel, but many zyss question why a priest should be in charge if their god is dead. Zyss thrive on selfish desires for hedonistic pleasure and adulation. They feel no love for others, even their offspring. Thriving on decadence, they crave receiving expensive gifts, gorging themselves on massive meals, and pursing arts such as music, poetry, or sculpture. Even more academic hobbies, like the study of magic or warfare, take an artistic bent, like carefully designing colorful illusions or memorizing epic poems about renowned wars. Each zyss believes themself to have more refined tastes than their peers.
Some serpentfolk might have entirely different innate spells. These alternative spells are typically illusions, enchantments, or divinations like dream message, enthrall, glibness, invisibility, mindlink, mind probe, mind reading, mislead, phantom pain, or zealous conviction. Aapoph serpentfolk lack innate spells.
Ydersius was defeated by an Azlanti heroine named Savith in the era before Earthfall, and now the so-called Headless King's body prowls aimlessly in the Darklands. That the decapitated god's clerics still gain power from worship points to Ydersius's tenacity and continued existence, after a fashion. Those who seek to recover his skull and return it to his body hope that doing so will restore both him and the sekmin civilization to their full power.
The war between the humans of ancient Azlant and the serpentfolk of Sekamina waged on for years. The serpentfolk's defeat threw their society into chaos and undermined their conviction that they would continue to rule simply because they had done so for eons. For millennia, serpentfolk have remained in hiding in their underground fortresses, but many feel it is time to rise again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Aasimar.
Mortals whose ancestry has been influenced by celestials are known as aasimars, and angelkin, who have blood of angels coursing through their veins, are among the most common type of them. Many angelkin seek adventure as a means of doing good in the world.
An important distinction exists between planar scions and extraplanar humanoids, such as fetchlings. Fetchlings and other extraplanar humanoids represent true ancestral groups with their own physical and cultural identities and traditions. Planar scions are members of diverse ancestries who share a similar inheritance from extraplanar beings and, with exception of marids, typically integrate into other humanoid societies instead of building their own.
As many types of planar scions exist as planes of existence, and even then there are significant differences between scions depending on the exact nature of their extraplanar forebears. Angelic scions are known as aasimars, fiendish scions are called tieflings, and monitor scions are urobians.
Two other planar scions are the entropy-infused ganzi and their polar opposites, the orderly aphorites, scions of chaos and law respectively.
Most planar scions are the distant descendants of some immortal progenitor far back in the family’s bloodline. Others, however, may be the result of powerful planar energies, magical curses, or even the intervention of a deity or demigod.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Abrikandilu (Wrecker Demon).
Wrecker demons, also known as abrikandilus, despise beautiful things and do everything in their power to destroy both people and objects that might be regarded as such. An abrikandilu forms from the soul of a mortal who in life was a vandal or defacer of artworks, particularly if those acts of destruction stemmed from feelings of powerful envy.
The only thing an abrikandilu loathes more than beauty is its own visage. The mere sight of its own face—reflected in a mirror, a shield, or even a pool of water—is enough to send a wrecker demon into a rage. Many demon slayers use this tactic to their advantage, venturing into battle with polished steel shields and cold iron blades at the ready.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications. For planar ally, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.
The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.
The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.
Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.
When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.
The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.
The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.
While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.
Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Adamantine Golem.
Crafted from a nigh-indestructible metal of great rarity, adamantine golems can’t be destroyed except by the most powerful foes. Crafting an adamantine golem requires a quantity of adamantine so massive that collecting it usually requires mounting a mining expedition to a distant planet, the Plane of Earth, or an Outer Plane.
Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called “golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.
Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell can affect the golem.
Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.
Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.
Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult Black Dragon.
Murderous tyrants of marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens, black dragons terrorize their domains with intense fervor. Gleefully sadistic, they rule their fetid principalities from a deep cave or otherwise isolated part of the swamp with a mix of lightning-quick raids and subterfuge. Their hatred for other creatures is as acidic as their breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons of their kind—except perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual enemy.
Black dragons are amphibious—although they breathe air, their gills also allow them to breathe water. Their frills and fins make them accomplished swimmers, well suited to their wetland environments and submerged lairs. They’re immune to the fetid water that comes as a result of their magical ability to corrupt water.
Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The floors are littered with rotting meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes, and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer substance can’t survive the dragon’s acidic presence.
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Each type of chromatic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a chromatic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.
The chromatic dragons that dwell around the Inner Sea region are cruel and sinister monsters who inspire as much fear as reverence. These terrible beasts are no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic and metallic dragons.
Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult Blue Dragon.
Blue dragons are the sleek and poised cosmopolitans of the chromatic dragons. Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon’s lackeys typically don’t even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.
Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they’re universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.
Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.
The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon’s true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel— expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult Brass Dragon.
Brass dragons are whimsical tricksters who delight in humor and play. They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society—networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.
These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don’t harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.
Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon’s prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.
Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals’ lives—and of their passing—always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don’t seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water—though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.
In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts (page 104–115), other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-fiung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:

Metallic dragons are found throughout the Inner Sea region, especially in pockets of wilderness where they can carve a hideout and then take action on political and social issues, both in their local area and on a wider scale. Their everlasting war with chromatic dragons keeps them in close proximity to their evil brethren; in regions where metallic and chromatic dragons’ territories intersect, humanoid settlements get caught in the crossfire, and villagers and city-dwellers alike rightfully fear for their own safety.
Silver dragons lair in abundance around the cold wastes west of Mendev, as a consequence of the days when they joined thousands of crusaders who marched headlong into the demon-infested Worldwound. Bronze dragons are abundant in Taldor, and many copper dragons lair in the wilds of Andoran, where they wage war alongside other freedom fighters to overthrow devils in the neighboring empire of Cheliax. Perhaps the most extreme example of a metallic dragon taking part in human affairs is on the island nation of Hermea, where Mengkare—an ancient gold wyrm—has begun a grand social experiment he calls “the Glorious Endeavor.” Ostensibly intended to create a future utopia on Golarion, this highly controversial experiment is instead regarded by many as a cruel and unusual form of eugenics.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult Brine Dragon.
Brine dragons are usually blue-green in color, with shiny scales, crests that help them glide through the water, and sweeping neck frills. They care little for either good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.
Depending on the dragon's personality, their community members might view their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.
Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed, or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged from sunken ships.
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an affinity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor arcane or divine magic. Although they come from distant planes, primal dragons can be found on the Material Plane in regions touched by or reminiscent of their home plane. Although such encounters are rare, adventurers and travelers have sometimes found a brine dragon dwelling near a salty inland sea, for example, or a crystal dragon living in massive natural caverns deep in the Darklands. Unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, primal dragons tend not to develop shape-changing powers, and they are less interested in infiltrating settlements or influencing others from the shadows.
Each type of primal dragon features a note in the margins on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a primal dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other primal spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Wisdom or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect their mastery of magic.
Golarion is not home to many primal dragons. Yet primal dragons do still come to Golarion now and then, whether to escape persecution in their home plane, build new lairs, torment and brutalize weaker creatures, or seek knowledge and resources that are scarce or unavailable at home.
Brine dragons can be found along Golarion’s coastlines but are often frustrated by piracy and other lawless elements. They tend to avoid heavily populated coastal areas like the Shackles and instead choose remote islands in the oceans as their homes, where they can rule small communities of their own curation. Cloud dragons are even more isolated, and lacking any interest in politics, they prefer to dwell in large mountain ranges like the Kodars or the Barrier Wall. Crystal dragons’ vanity compels them to seek places that complement their natural beauty, such as gem-studded caverns in the Darklands. Of all the primal dragons, cantankerous magma dragons may be the ones most often found dwelling on Golarion, where they are drawn to volcanic ranges like the Five Kings Mountains. Umbral dragons hail not from an Elemental Plane but the Shadow Plane, and they can be encountered anywhere the borders to that plane grow thin, particularly in the sinister nation of Nidal.
Brine dragon spellcasters tend to cast the following spells.

A series of underwater caverns on Thoska Isle in the Ironbound Archipelago serves as Rezlarabren's lair. There she rules a tribe of ulat-kini who labor as miners. Her relationship with the Linnorm Kings is complex, and whether she views them as allies or enemies depends on her mood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult Bronze Dragon.
Bronze dragons are among the most common of metallic dragons and the most likely to ally with mortals on worthy quests. However, they are naturally scholarly creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists, guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.
Bronze dragons’ mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon’s enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.
While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library—with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult Cloud Dragon.
At heart, cloud dragons are wanderers, explorers, and travelers who enjoy nothing more than seeing new lands and meeting unusual creatures. Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.
A cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw—they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.
Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a cloud dragon, a diversified hoard is a perfect hoard.
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an affinity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor arcane or divine magic. Although they come from distant planes, primal dragons can be found on the Material Plane in regions touched by or reminiscent of their home plane. Although such encounters are rare, adventurers and travelers have sometimes found a brine dragon dwelling near a salty inland sea, for example, or a crystal dragon living in massive natural caverns deep in the Darklands. Unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, primal dragons tend not to develop shape-changing powers, and they are less interested in infiltrating settlements or influencing others from the shadows.
Each type of primal dragon features a note in the margins on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a primal dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other primal spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Wisdom or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect their mastery of magic.
Golarion is not home to many primal dragons. Yet primal dragons do still come to Golarion now and then, whether to escape persecution in their home plane, build new lairs, torment and brutalize weaker creatures, or seek knowledge and resources that are scarce or unavailable at home.
Brine dragons can be found along Golarion’s coastlines but are often frustrated by piracy and other lawless elements. They tend to avoid heavily populated coastal areas like the Shackles and instead choose remote islands in the oceans as their homes, where they can rule small communities of their own curation. Cloud dragons are even more isolated, and lacking any interest in politics, they prefer to dwell in large mountain ranges like the Kodars or the Barrier Wall. Crystal dragons’ vanity compels them to seek places that complement their natural beauty, such as gem-studded caverns in the Darklands. Of all the primal dragons, cantankerous magma dragons may be the ones most often found dwelling on Golarion, where they are drawn to volcanic ranges like the Five Kings Mountains. Umbral dragons hail not from an Elemental Plane but the Shadow Plane, and they can be encountered anywhere the borders to that plane grow thin, particularly in the sinister nation of Nidal.
Cloud dragon spellcasters tend to cast the following spells.
While most cloud dragons prefer solitude and avoid confrontations, Zanembis is an excellent example of how failed dragonslaying attempts can create problems. Previously content to dwell atop Angel Peak in the Mindspin Mountains, this cloud dragon has grown vengeful and violent in the wake of unexpected and unjustified attacks on his lair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult Copper Dragon.
Capricious and always eager to share a good laugh, copper dragons are among the wiliest of the metallic dragons, but this by no means interferes with their mission to spread freedom in oppressive lands. Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they’re also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.
Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.
A copper dragon’s combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless with laughter.
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals’ lives—and of their passing—always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don’t seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water—though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.
In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts (page 104–115), other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-fiung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation); The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage modifiers with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Each type of metallic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that kind. To make a metallic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.
Metallic dragons are found throughout the Inner Sea region, especially in pockets of wilderness where they can carve a hideout and then take action on political and social issues, both in their local area and on a wider scale. Their everlasting war with chromatic dragons keeps them in close proximity to their evil brethren; in regions where metallic and chromatic dragons’ territories intersect, humanoid settlements get caught in the crossfire, and villagers and city-dwellers alike rightfully fear for their own safety.
Silver dragons lair in abundance around the cold wastes west of Mendev, as a consequence of the days when they joined thousands of crusaders who marched headlong into the demon-infested Worldwound. Bronze dragons are abundant in Taldor, and many copper dragons lair in the wilds of Andoran, where they wage war alongside other freedom fighters to overthrow devils in the neighboring empire of Cheliax. Perhaps the most extreme example of a metallic dragon taking part in human affairs is on the island nation of Hermea, where Mengkare—an ancient gold wyrm—has begun a grand social experiment he calls “the Glorious Endeavor.” Ostensibly intended to create a future utopia on Golarion, this highly controversial experiment is instead regarded by many as a cruel and unusual form of eugenics.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult Crystal Dragon.
Good-natured but vain, crystal dragons are beautiful creatures with brilliant hides made of multicolored crystal and gemstone. Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.
Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.
Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to find evil creatures uncouth and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature's capacity for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that crystal dragons hunger for).

Still a relatively young crystal dragon, Shardizhad has already made a name for herself in the city of Wati in Osirion. She has taken on a somewhat unusual role as a shopkeeper in that city's necropolis, where she's eager to trade magic items she's collected for more gems and valuable stones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult Gold Dragon.
Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.
When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.
A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.
Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals’ lives—and of their passing—always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don’t seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult Green Dragon.
Green dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon’s fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.
Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.
Green dragons’ pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.
Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).

You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.
The chromatic dragons that dwell around the Inner Sea region are cruel and sinister monsters who inspire as much fear as reverence. These terrible beasts are no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic and metallic dragons.
Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult Magma Dragon.
Magma dragons have a reputation among other dragons for being unpredictable and brash. Their temperament and tendency for violent outbursts ensure that the typical magma dragon lives a solitary life, with hatchlings often bickering or fighting to establish dominance among themselves before they leave the nest. A magma dragon always has a reason for their outbursts and can always justify their sudden turns in mood, yet they rarely feel the need to do so.
Magma dragons build lairs within volcanically active mountains or deep underground amid vast lakes of bubbling magma. As with all true dragons, magma dragons keep hoards of treasure, but the nature of their searing lairs limits the type of valuables they collect to metals, gems, and items capable of resisting the heat of a volcano's core.
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an affinity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor arcane or divine magic. Although they come from distant planes, primal dragons can be found on the Material Plane in regions touched by or reminiscent of their home plane. Although such encounters are rare, adventurers and travelers have sometimes found a brine dragon dwelling near a salty inland sea, for example, or a crystal dragon living in massive natural caverns deep in the Darklands.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult Red Dragon.
The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons are a menace to civilizations everywhere, and their strength is rivaled only by their arrogance. Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering frame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes—only unquestioned fact.
Red dragons don’t deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon’s security.
Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals—or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance.
As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous places, with volcanoes being a favorite spot, as they find them foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable. No matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and other treasures, which they zealously guard. Sometimes, the dragon’s internal heat causes these precious metals to fuse together.
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult Silver Dragon.
Silver dragons are among the most chivalrous of all dragonkind; they wield frost and cold as weapons, can walk on clouds, and dwell high upon snowy mountain peaks or deep in steep, misty valleys. Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.
Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.
Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.
Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty.

Change Shape (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation); The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage modifiers with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Each type of metallic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that kind. To make a metallic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.
Metallic dragons are found throughout the Inner Sea region, especially in pockets of wilderness where they can carve a hideout and then take action on political and social issues, both in their local area and on a wider scale. Their everlasting war with chromatic dragons keeps them in close proximity to their evil brethren; in regions where metallic and chromatic dragons’ territories intersect, humanoid settlements get caught in the crossfire, and villagers and city-dwellers alike rightfully fear for their own safety.
Silver dragons lair in abundance around the cold wastes west of Mendev, as a consequence of the days when they joined thousands of crusaders who marched headlong into the demon-infested Worldwound. Bronze dragons are abundant in Taldor, and many copper dragons lair in the wilds of Andoran, where they wage war alongside other freedom fighters to overthrow devils in the neighboring empire of Cheliax. Perhaps the most extreme example of a metallic dragon taking part in human affairs is on the island nation of Hermea, where Mengkare—an ancient gold wyrm—has begun a grand social experiment he calls “the Glorious Endeavor.” Ostensibly intended to create a future utopia on Golarion, this highly controversial experiment is instead regarded by many as a cruel and unusual form of eugenics.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult Umbral Dragon.
While the other primal dragons hail from the Elemental Planes, the cruel and unceasingly malicious umbral dragons originate in the depths of the Shadow Plane. Their sleek black scales and serpentine grace allow them to strike from hiding, and they are known for playing with their prey before finally finishing it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.
For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an affinity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor arcane or divine magic. Although they come from distant planes, primal dragons can be found on the Material Plane in regions touched by or reminiscent of their home plane. Although such encounters are rare, adventurers and travelers have sometimes found a brine dragon dwelling near a salty inland sea, for example, or a crystal dragon living in massive natural caverns deep in the Darklands. Unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, primal dragons tend not to develop shape-changing powers, and they are less interested in infiltrating settlements or influencing others from the shadows.
Each type of primal dragon features a note in the margins on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a primal dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other primal spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Wisdom or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect their mastery of magic.
Golarion is not home to many primal dragons. Yet primal dragons do still come to Golarion now and then, whether to escape persecution in their home plane, build new lairs, torment and brutalize weaker creatures, or seek knowledge and resources that are scarce or unavailable at home.
Brine dragons can be found along Golarion’s coastlines but are often frustrated by piracy and other lawless elements. They tend to avoid heavily populated coastal areas like the Shackles and instead choose remote islands in the oceans as their homes, where they can rule small communities of their own curation. Cloud dragons are even more isolated, and lacking any interest in politics, they prefer to dwell in large mountain ranges like the Kodars or the Barrier Wall. Crystal dragons’ vanity compels them to seek places that complement their natural beauty, such as gem-studded caverns in the Darklands. Of all the primal dragons, cantankerous magma dragons may be the ones most often found dwelling on Golarion, where they are drawn to volcanic ranges like the Five Kings Mountains. Umbral dragons hail not from an Elemental Plane but the Shadow Plane, and they can be encountered anywhere the borders to that plane grow thin, particularly in the sinister nation of Nidal.
Denizens of the Midnight Mountains in the Darklands worship the ancient umbral dragon Ugothogo as a deity.
Umbral dragon spellcasters tend to cast the following spells.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Adult White Dragon.
The most feral and least intelligent of all the chromatic dragons, white dragons are brutish, predatory, and chiefly motivated by self-preservation. Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous—in fact, it may mean the opposite. It’s nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don’t care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking—and when the attack comes, it’s bloody and relentless.
Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon’s territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility—such as tools, trade goods, and fine food—over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they’ve decorated their homes over the years.
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Each type of chromatic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a chromatic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.
The chromatic dragons that dwell around the Inner Sea region are cruel and sinister monsters who inspire as much fear as reverence. These terrible beasts are no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic and metallic dragons.
Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Ahuizotl.
The ahuizotl is a vicious, semi-aquatic predator that resembles a hideous cross between a badger and an otter, with disturbingly web-fingered paws supplemented by a fifth hand at the end of a long, serpentine tail. A clever and stealthy hunter, the ahuizotl lures unwary prey to their doom by mimicking the cries of people in distress. The ahuizotl's macabre habit of feeding on a victim's eyes, fingernails, and teeth leaves the corpses of its kills uniquely mutilated. Some say the creatures consider these body parts delicacies, while others insist ahuizotls collect them as tribute to a powerful but unknown entity. The fact that an ahuizotl does not eat the actual flesh of its victims, instead depositing their savaged and waterlogged corpses in locations where the remains are sure to be found by friends or family, points to a third and perhaps more likely possibility—the ahuizotl simply enjoys using its violent dietary quirks to spread fear and despair.
An ahuizotl walks on all fours, but its hands are capable of manipulating simple tools and other objects. Ahuizotls have roughly mustelid features and an extra membrane covering their eyes, giving their eyes a dull color suggestive of cataracts and somewhat blunting the creature's vision. Yet despite their bestial appearance, ahuizotls are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and wiser than most. Although they don't form societies of their own, they have been known to ally with violent cults or conclaves of monsters, and even to found small shrines and temples to sinister deities. The cult of Charon, the horseman of Death, is particularly popular among certain ahuizotls, who look forward to an afterlife spent wallowing in the waters of the River Styx.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ahvothian.
Ahvothians are feral and cunning fiends from an Abyssal realm of jungles, dinosaurs, and relentless brutality. They resemble humanoid dinosaurs with narrow, fanged heads similar to raptors and solid, heavy legs like sauropods. Relentless trackers and survivalists, ahvothians are skilled at navigating jungles and are most commonly encountered stalking prey or operating out of fortified ruins. Ahvothians have an uncanny affinity with reptiles, and they often use dinosaurs—particularly carnivores such as allosauruses or deinonychuses—as hunting companions or guard animals. Although dangerous in large groups, ahvothians have such a strong desire to assert dominance over others that ahvothian armies frequently fall to infighting and bloody battles for dominance within days, or even hours. The mightiest ahvothians might lead dozens of their kin and herds of carnivorous dinosaurs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Air Mephit.
Air mephits are capricious and flighty relative to their kin; they are as likely to fly blindly into battle as they are to whine in terror at a loud noise. They are pale blue in coloration and have thin wings that trail small puffs of vapor as they fly through the skies.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Mephits are a favorite target for low-level spellcasters to summon, both because they have several useful abilities and because they are relatively easy to command and manipulate. Still, care must be taken when using mephits as minions, because if left unwatched or unattended for too long, they can cause all sorts of mischief.
Different types of mephits that can be found on the same elemental plane often develop friendly (or, in some cases, fierce) rivalries with one another. While mephits from elementally opposed planes (such as fire and water) may have strong opinions about the superiority of their own element, the fact that they rarely see such mephits means that when they do encounter them, they often get along better than they do with their close neighbors.
Perhaps because they're so often compelled into service by mortal conjurers and more powerful elementals, mephits tend to adopt long names peppered with self-proclaimed titles and imagined or exaggerated accomplishments to alleviate their feelings of inadequacy. Some examples of mephit names follow. Anothoraxia, Lurker in Dark Places, the Tragic Hero, One Against AllSilothiscil the Embittered, Rimelord of the Eternal Chill, Lord of IciclesOglophax, Prince of Pungency, the Viscous One, the Forever StainZarnozath the Magnificent, First of His Name, Boiler of Kettles, the Teapot Terror
The four mephits presented here are but the most common of their kind. Others that rise from the mixing of elemental energies exist as well: creatures like dust mephits (who breathe out a scouring cloud of grit), ice mephits (who spit out sickening gusts of frozen air), magma mephits (which can assume the form of a pool of lava), ooze mephits (which spit out foul-smelling acid), salt mephits (who can draw moisture out of the environs and nearby creatures), and steam mephits (which can call down tiny squalls of boiling rain).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Aiudara Wraith.
Dahak’s influence in Alseta’s Landing created a soul-draining effect that slays unprotected creatures within, transforming them into ghostly creatures known as aiudara wraiths, but these rare undead can rise within modern aiudara portals as well. Each time an individual travels through an aiudara, there’s a chance their passage could leave a faint imprint of their subconscious in the network. Normally this imprint simply fades away, but when an aiudara is damaged or the individual is suffering from necromantic contagions, these imprints can accumulate and, in time, coalesce on the Astral Plane or within Alseta’s Landing as a full-fledged aiudara wraith. The wraith is forced to live with an incomplete sense of self, always seeking its own memories and swiftly growing violent and vengeful as its quest to reclaim these ephemeral notions constantly meets with failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Akata.
An akata is a hairless, blue-skinned quadruped with fearsome jaws, glowing eyes, a pair of thin tails, and a mane of writhing tentacles. It is a strangely silent beast, as it lacks the lungs and vocal chords necessary to vocalize. It also lacks ears, but it has heightened visual and olfactory senses.
When food is scarce, an akata secretes a resin from its pores that forms into a sturdy cocoon of pale green crystal—the skymetal noqual. An akata can hibernate in this cocoon without needing to eat or drink for centuries, though it retains a rudimentary sense of its surroundings and can break out in only a few minutes' time. These cocoons allow the creatures to travel through the void of space, seeking new worlds where they can infect suitable humanoid hosts with their larval young. Once a victim succumbs to this infection, the offspring fight among themselves until one proves the strongest. The surviving akata then animates the corpse—now a void zombie—which shambles about of its own accord.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Akizendri.
Akizendris gnaw at sources of knowledge and lore, gleefully corrupting and altering them to vex scholars and sages across the planes with contradictions and untruths. These proteans appear as cackling, serpentine creatures with elongated crocodilian faces, luminous eyes, and arms that vanish at the elbows into swirling clouds of runes before reforming into solid talons.
Akizendris amuse themselves by rearranging or deleting texts, placing insulting acrostics in poetic verses, and penning crude insults upon title pages. Libraries in such places as Heaven, Axis, and Hell are especially keen to avoid such contamination, knowing that their records are choice targets for every akizendri in existence.
Proteans divide themselves into a loose caste system and possess a dizzying variety of powers. Most proteans have a serpentine body with the head of a primeval beast. Scholars have long been intrigued by this fact—that scions of dissolution and disorder would share so many features—pointing out that even in the purest chaos there is some semblance of order. Others note that the serpentine form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion and lack of consensus surrounding their kind. After all, if even chaos cannot be trusted to be chaotic, would that not be the purest form of entropy?
Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves. When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature. D8Warpwave Effect 1Clumsy 2 (3 on a critical failure) 2Confused and gains 4d6 temporary Hit Points 3Dazzled (permanent on a critical failure) 4Enfeebled 2 (3 on a critical failure) 5Immobilized by filaments of energy 6Quickened (Stride, Strike, or Step only) 7Slowed 1 8Stupefied 2 (3 on a critical failure)
Among the numerous types of immortals that dwell in the Great Beyond, the proteans are surely some of the oldest. They’ve waged war against the inevitable aeons from the advent of their first creation, and speak longingly of that time before the gods themselves imposed order upon reality.
The Maelstrom, home of all proteans, is the whirling mass of turbulent primal energy, planar waves, and soul-stuff that surrounds the Outer Planes. Planar scholars theorize that all of reality was originally formed from the Maelstrom in the early days of the cosmos—a theory proteans don’t necessarily dispute.
Where proteans go, chaos follows. To proteans, there is no purer form of existence than entropy, and they constantly seek to oppose the establishment of order in the Great Beyond. However, proteans don’t see life as being incompatible with chaos; rather, they simply believe beings—immortal or not—deserve complete freedom on their own terms.
Many other proteans beyond those presented here dwell in the Maelstrom, including the spectral pelagastrs, the nearly humanoid shapechanging ourdivars, and the incredibly powerful izfiitars.
The most powerful of all proteans are a group of demigods known collectively as protean lords. Yet even their vast might pales in comparison to that of the mysterious Speakers of the Depths. The Speakers are the most enigmatic of the Maelstrom’s gods—even their exact nature is unknown, and scholars disagree as to whether they are even divinities or just aspects of the Maelstrom itself.
Individual proteans have two names: a traditional name in their hissing, confusing language; and an honorary title. The latter is easily translated to other languages, but a protean’s traditional name can only rarely be uttered in any tongue other than Protean. As such, most proteans tend to go by their titles when dealing with outsiders, referring to themselves as, for example, “Song of Gentle Poison” or “Sibilant Cry of the Storm.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Alchemical Golem.
This golem is a walking alchemical nightmare capable of inflicting all manner of painful wounds. Its ability to follow orders is granted by the otherwise mindless humanoid brain that floats in its dome-like head. In exceptionally rare cases, the brain used in its creation might retain fragments of memories or even actual intellect, resulting in an alchemical golem with a personality and agenda of its own.
Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called “golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.
Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell can affect the golem.
Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.
Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.
Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Alghollthu Master (Aboleth).
Aboleths form the core of alghollthu society, and while they are the “common folk” of their own societies, they see themselves as masters of all others. Unlike their leaders, who mask their actions using magical disguises, aboleths revel in their monstrous forms, appearing as primeval fish with tentacles. Masters of psychic manipulation, they are a species so ancient that they were present in the world when it was young, before the gods had turned their attention to the planet. They see all other life as something they have the right to control, so the idea that potential slaves might have faith in a higher power other than themselves enrages aboleths.
In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave societies and sought to wipe the slate clean—both starting anew and punishing those who had become too willful and rebellious. They used incredible magical power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they’d manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew strong once again—this time without alghollthu influence.
Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a frightening possibility—that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the surface once again.
The ruling castes of the alghollthu species dwell in oceanic depths or underground waterways, while their servitors like ulat-kinis and ugothols can often be found in coastal regions and marshes.
Although most alghollthus lack the greed that tempts most mortals, they do gather wealth and magical tools to use in their schemes. A given aboleth or veiled master might also wear magical jewelry and other objects. Faceless stalkers and other humanoid servants of alghollthus use weapons and armor, such as the faceless stalker’s sword or ulat-kini’s trident, as well as other tools. These servitor races can be as acquisitive as other humanoids.
While the veiled masters are the rulers of alghollthu society, they are not the most powerful of their kind. Greater, more mysterious creatures that function as organic thought networks, immense aquatic engines of war, or specialized extractors of forgotten secrets dwell among their sunken cities. Meanwhile, the world above remains infested with creatures that were originally created by the alghollthus but have long since drifted away from their aquatic progenitors to become their own sinister monstrosities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Aluum Enforcer.
The most common aluum is powered by the bound soul of a loyal city servant, but its creation is among the Pactmasters’ most guarded secrets. There are dozens of dormant aluums spread throughout Katapesh, and only someone wearing an aluum charm can activate and command one of these 14-foot-tall soldiers. The Pactmasters entrust few beyond the Zephyr Guard to carry these charms, and stealing such a charm is one of the most severe crimes in the city.
Retired Zephyr Guards are the most common soul donors bound within an aluum’s crystalline focus, typically agreeing to it early in their career in exchange for a higher salary.
Although members of the Zephyr Guard stop at nothing to detain and destroy rogue aluums, several such renegade spiritbound aluums remain at large.
Daemon of Dogtown: Following the Silk Riots of 4303 AR, the Pactmasters dispatched this aluum to eliminate straggling instigators. It succeeded, but not before gaining sentience and enacting a 3-day string of murders. Although officials claim it was destroyed, the so-called Daemon of Dogtown’s body was never actually recovered, leading to rumors that it still haunts the outskirts of Katapesh.
Queen Halkuar: Assigned to protect a gnoll emissary from the Spotted Hide pack, this aluum failed to protect its charge from assassins. Instinctively, it bound the gnoll’s soul, assumed the fabricated persona of “Queen Halkuar,” and fled into the hinterlands. The queen is said to still wander the wastes in search of additional “packmates.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ammut.
These chimeric, desert-dwelling fiends have massive bodies that are part hippopotamus, part large cat, and part crocodile. Though they devour souls for sustenance, ammuts are infamously picky eaters; most will only eat experienced adventurers or, for a special treat, particularly evil creatures, passing over common folk or those whose mettle has never been tested.
Only a few ammuts are known to exist, and most dwell in Osirion. However, recent expeditions into Orv's Vault of the Black Desert have uncovered the existence of ammuts in this region, as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Amoeba Swarm.
An amoeba swarm consists of thousands of individual single-celled organisms held together by acrid-smelling slime. As ravenous as they are mindless, amoeba swarms use no tactics.
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms are usually found near each other, as the two oozes are part of the same life cycle. When a giant amoeba grows large enough, it can spontaneously split apart into two separate amoeba swarms, and when an amoeba swarm feeds enough, its individual components can fuse together into a single creature.
Many oozes have acidic attacks that can quickly degrade flesh, wood, and even stronger materials. Some believe that oozes are the result of alchemical or magical experimentation run amok, while others postulate that they simply emerged from the natural processes of evolution.
Many varieties of these nearly mindless predators exist in the world. Some are mere variants, with different colored puddings, jellies, and oozes with little to differentiate them from those presented here other than their habitat. Others are more specialized, or even dangerously intelligent. The shoggoth is one such example, but another variety of deadly and powerful ooze is the thankfully rare blight, a creature composed of protoplasm and eyes that curses entire regions with its presence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Anadi Elder.
Anadi elders must make the difficult decision of whether to continue negotiations or to escalate a disagreement to outright conflict.
Anadis have an innate talent for illusion and transmutation. They learned long ago how off-putting their natural forms can be to other humanoids, so they frequently use their innate talents to assume human forms. When they do so, only a strange, lovely sheen to their dark eyes and the deliberative, jerky movements of their gestures might indicate that an anadi is not entirely what they appear to be. Given their tendency to accommodate humans’ delicate sensibilities toward arachnids, most anadis consider showing their natural forms to a stranger a rather rude display. Instead, most display their spider-like forms only as an intimidation tactic when threatened. When forced into combat—an eventuality most anadis despise—they shift into their true forms as soon as possible, allowing them to inflict their devastating natural venom on their foes.
The largest group of anadis live in Garund in the nation of Nurvatcha. Other anadi clans and villages exist in the surrounding region. Anadis are also present in Casmaron and on some of Azlant's smaller islands. Regardless of where they live, they share common values and cultural characteristics.
Many anadi villages believe deeply in the teachings of Grandmother Spider, the goddess of twilight, weaving, illusion, and family. The most devout anadi believe that this goddess, sometimes called Nana Anadi, long ago led their ancestors from servitude. The legend goes that when the anadi were frightened by the darkness, Grandmother Spider plucked the dewdrops from her web to hang in the sky and light the night for them. Nana Anadi is an honorary matriarch to many in Nurvatcha, though the goddess has never taken the nation's throne—and most believe she would never wish to do so, anyway.
Anadis are communal when it comes to courting one another and raising their young. Most relationships are triads or tetrads that make up a single household and share domestic responsibilities. Such partnerships often extend to members' work outside of the home; one family could consist of three hunters who coordinate group hunts, while another might have four sages who spend as much time together in the library as at home. These “web marriages” play a large role in anadi society; members of a web marriage vote in blocks during local elections and defend one another to the death in times of strife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Anadi Hunter.

Anadi sages commune with nature and hone their magic through practice.
Anadis have an innate talent for illusion and transmutation. They learned long ago how off-putting their natural forms can be to other humanoids, so they frequently use their innate talents to assume human forms. When they do so, only a strange, lovely sheen to their dark eyes and the deliberative, jerky movements of their gestures might indicate that an anadi is not entirely what they appear to be. Given their tendency to accommodate humans’ delicate sensibilities toward arachnids, most anadis consider showing their natural forms to a stranger a rather rude display. Instead, most display their spider-like forms only as an intimidation tactic when threatened. When forced into combat—an eventuality most anadis despise—they shift into their true forms as soon as possible, allowing them to inflict their devastating natural venom on their foes.
The largest group of anadis live in Garund in the nation of Nurvatcha. Other anadi clans and villages exist in the surrounding region. Anadis are also present in Casmaron and on some of Azlant's smaller islands. Regardless of where they live, they share common values and cultural characteristics.
Many anadi villages believe deeply in the teachings of Grandmother Spider, the goddess of twilight, weaving, illusion, and family. The most devout anadi believe that this goddess, sometimes called Nana Anadi, long ago led their ancestors from servitude. The legend goes that when the anadi were frightened by the darkness, Grandmother Spider plucked the dewdrops from her web to hang in the sky and light the night for them. Nana Anadi is an honorary matriarch to many in Nurvatcha, though the goddess has never taken the nation's throne—and most believe she would never wish to do so, anyway.
Anadis are communal when it comes to courting one another and raising their young. Most relationships are triads or tetrads that make up a single household and share domestic responsibilities. Such partnerships often extend to members' work outside of the home; one family could consist of three hunters who coordinate group hunts, while another might have four sages who spend as much time together in the library as at home. These “web marriages” play a large role in anadi society; members of a web marriage vote in blocks during local elections and defend one another to the death in times of strife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Anancus.
The anancus is an ancient species of elephant with unusually long tusks and a trunk shorter than its more modern cousins.
Elephant tusks are a highly sought-after treasure, the ivory from a single tusk potentially fetching hundreds of gold coins. Those who value the elephant’s majestic presence are impassioned defenders of the creatures, making the hunt for ivory dangerous.
Elephants of all species are, by nature, social creatures who form strong bonds with one another, but when an elephant separates from its herd—either due to tragedy or an individual streak of viciousness—they become known as rogue elephants. These dangerous solitary creatures are ill-tempered and quick to attack anything that approaches them, and often have the elite adjustments to their statistics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient Black Dragon.
Murderous tyrants of marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens, black dragons terrorize their domains with intense fervor. Gleefully sadistic, they rule their fetid principalities from a deep cave or otherwise isolated part of the swamp with a mix of lightning-quick raids and subterfuge. Their hatred for other creatures is as acidic as their breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons of their kind—except perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual enemy.
Black dragons are amphibious—although they breathe air, their gills also allow them to breathe water. Their frills and fins make them accomplished swimmers, well suited to their wetland environments and submerged lairs. They’re immune to the fetid water that comes as a result of their magical ability to corrupt water.
Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The floors are littered with rotting meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes, and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer substance can’t survive the dragon’s acidic presence.
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Each type of chromatic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a chromatic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.
The chromatic dragons that dwell around the Inner Sea region are cruel and sinister monsters who inspire as much fear as reverence. These terrible beasts are no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic and metallic dragons.
Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient Blue Dragon.
Blue dragons are the sleek and poised cosmopolitans of the chromatic dragons. Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon’s lackeys typically don’t even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.
Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they’re universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.
Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.
The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon’s true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel— expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient Brass Dragon.
Brass dragons are whimsical tricksters who delight in humor and play. They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society—networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.
These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don’t harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.
Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon’s prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.
Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals’ lives—and of their passing—always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don’t seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water—though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.
In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts (page 104–115), other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-fiung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation); The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage modifiers with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).

Metallic dragons are found throughout the Inner Sea region, especially in pockets of wilderness where they can carve a hideout and then take action on political and social issues, both in their local area and on a wider scale. Their everlasting war with chromatic dragons keeps them in close proximity to their evil brethren; in regions where metallic and chromatic dragons’ territories intersect, humanoid settlements get caught in the crossfire, and villagers and city-dwellers alike rightfully fear for their own safety.
Silver dragons lair in abundance around the cold wastes west of Mendev, as a consequence of the days when they joined thousands of crusaders who marched headlong into the demon-infested Worldwound. Bronze dragons are abundant in Taldor, and many copper dragons lair in the wilds of Andoran, where they wage war alongside other freedom fighters to overthrow devils in the neighboring empire of Cheliax. Perhaps the most extreme example of a metallic dragon taking part in human affairs is on the island nation of Hermea, where Mengkare—an ancient gold wyrm—has begun a grand social experiment he calls “the Glorious Endeavor.” Ostensibly intended to create a future utopia on Golarion, this highly controversial experiment is instead regarded by many as a cruel and unusual form of eugenics.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient Brine Dragon.
Brine dragons are usually blue-green in color, with shiny scales, crests that help them glide through the water, and sweeping neck frills. They care little for either good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.
Depending on the dragon's personality, their community members might view their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.
Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed, or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged from sunken ships.
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an affinity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor arcane or divine magic. Although they come from distant planes, primal dragons can be found on the Material Plane in regions touched by or reminiscent of their home plane. Although such encounters are rare, adventurers and travelers have sometimes found a brine dragon dwelling near a salty inland sea, for example, or a crystal dragon living in massive natural caverns deep in the Darklands. Unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, primal dragons tend not to develop shape-changing powers, and they are less interested in infiltrating settlements or influencing others from the shadows.
Each type of primal dragon features a note in the margins on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a primal dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other primal spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Wisdom or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect their mastery of magic.
Golarion is not home to many primal dragons. Yet primal dragons do still come to Golarion now and then, whether to escape persecution in their home plane, build new lairs, torment and brutalize weaker creatures, or seek knowledge and resources that are scarce or unavailable at home.
Brine dragons can be found along Golarion’s coastlines but are often frustrated by piracy and other lawless elements. They tend to avoid heavily populated coastal areas like the Shackles and instead choose remote islands in the oceans as their homes, where they can rule small communities of their own curation. Cloud dragons are even more isolated, and lacking any interest in politics, they prefer to dwell in large mountain ranges like the Kodars or the Barrier Wall. Crystal dragons’ vanity compels them to seek places that complement their natural beauty, such as gem-studded caverns in the Darklands. Of all the primal dragons, cantankerous magma dragons may be the ones most often found dwelling on Golarion, where they are drawn to volcanic ranges like the Five Kings Mountains. Umbral dragons hail not from an Elemental Plane but the Shadow Plane, and they can be encountered anywhere the borders to that plane grow thin, particularly in the sinister nation of Nidal.
Brine dragon spellcasters tend to cast the following spells.

A series of underwater caverns on Thoska Isle in the Ironbound Archipelago serves as Rezlarabren's lair. There she rules a tribe of ulat-kini who labor as miners. Her relationship with the Linnorm Kings is complex, and whether she views them as allies or enemies depends on her mood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient Bronze Dragon.
Bronze dragons are among the most common of metallic dragons and the most likely to ally with mortals on worthy quests. However, they are naturally scholarly creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists, guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.
Bronze dragons’ mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon’s enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath.
Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves. While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library—with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient Cloud Dragon.
At heart, cloud dragons are wanderers, explorers, and travelers who enjoy nothing more than seeing new lands and meeting unusual creatures. Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.
A cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw—they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.
Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a cloud dragon, a diversified hoard is a perfect hoard.
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an affinity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor arcane or divine magic. Although they come from distant planes, primal dragons can be found on the Material Plane in regions touched by or reminiscent of their home plane.

Cloud dragon spellcasters tend to cast the following spells.
While most cloud dragons prefer solitude and avoid confrontations, Zanembis is an excellent example of how failed dragonslaying attempts can create problems. Previously content to dwell atop Angel Peak in the Mindspin Mountains, this cloud dragon has grown vengeful and violent in the wake of unexpected and unjustified attacks on his lair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient Copper Dragon.
Capricious and always eager to share a good laugh, copper dragons are among the wiliest of the metallic dragons, but this by no means interferes with their mission to spread freedom in oppressive lands. Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they’re also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.
Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.
A copper dragon’s combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless with laughter.
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient Crystal Dragon.
Good-natured but vain, crystal dragons are beautiful creatures with brilliant hides made of multicolored crystal and gemstone. Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.
Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.
Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to find evil creatures uncouth and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature's capacity for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that crystal dragons hunger for).
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an affinity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor arcane or divine magic. Although they come from distant planes, primal dragons can be found on the Material Plane in regions touched by or reminiscent of their home plane. Although such encounters are rare, adventurers and travelers have sometimes found a brine dragon dwelling near a salty inland sea, for example, or a crystal dragon living in massive natural caverns deep in the Darklands. Unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, primal dragons tend not to develop shape-changing powers, and they are less interested in infiltrating settlements or influencing others from the shadows.
Each type of primal dragon features a note in the margins on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a primal dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other primal spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Wisdom or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect their mastery of magic.
Golarion is not home to many primal dragons. Yet primal dragons do still come to Golarion now and then, whether to escape persecution in their home plane, build new lairs, torment and brutalize weaker creatures, or seek knowledge and resources that are scarce or unavailable at home.
Brine dragons can be found along Golarion’s coastlines but are often frustrated by piracy and other lawless elements. They tend to avoid heavily populated coastal areas like the Shackles and instead choose remote islands in the oceans as their homes, where they can rule small communities of their own curation. Cloud dragons are even more isolated, and lacking any interest in politics, they prefer to dwell in large mountain ranges like the Kodars or the Barrier Wall. Crystal dragons’ vanity compels them to seek places that complement their natural beauty, such as gem-studded caverns in the Darklands. Of all the primal dragons, cantankerous magma dragons may be the ones most often found dwelling on Golarion, where they are drawn to volcanic ranges like the Five Kings Mountains. Umbral dragons hail not from an Elemental Plane but the Shadow Plane, and they can be encountered anywhere the borders to that plane grow thin, particularly in the sinister nation of Nidal.
Crystal dragon spellcasters tend to cast the following spells.
Still a relatively young crystal dragon, Shardizhad has already made a name for herself in the city of Wati in Osirion. She has taken on a somewhat unusual role as a shopkeeper in that city's necropolis, where she's eager to trade magic items she's collected for more gems and valuable stones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient Gold Dragon.
Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.
When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.
A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.
Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals’ lives—and of their passing—always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don’t seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water—though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.
In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts (page 104–115), other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-fiung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation); The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage modifiers with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Each type of metallic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that kind. To make a metallic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.
Metallic dragons are found throughout the Inner Sea region, especially in pockets of wilderness where they can carve a hideout and then take action on political and social issues, both in their local area and on a wider scale. Their everlasting war with chromatic dragons keeps them in close proximity to their evil brethren; in regions where metallic and chromatic dragons’ territories intersect, humanoid settlements get caught in the crossfire, and villagers and city-dwellers alike rightfully fear for their own safety.
Silver dragons lair in abundance around the cold wastes west of Mendev, as a consequence of the days when they joined thousands of crusaders who marched headlong into the demon-infested Worldwound. Bronze dragons are abundant in Taldor, and many copper dragons lair in the wilds of Andoran, where they wage war alongside other freedom fighters to overthrow devils in the neighboring empire of Cheliax. Perhaps the most extreme example of a metallic dragon taking part in human affairs is on the island nation of Hermea, where Mengkare—an ancient gold wyrm—has begun a grand social experiment he calls “the Glorious Endeavor.” Ostensibly intended to create a future utopia on Golarion, this highly controversial experiment is instead regarded by many as a cruel and unusual form of eugenics.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient Green Dragon.
Green dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon’s fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.
Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.
Green dragons’ pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.
Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:

The chromatic dragons that dwell around the Inner Sea region are cruel and sinister monsters who inspire as much fear as reverence. These terrible beasts are no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic and metallic dragons.
Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient Magma Dragon.
Magma dragons have a reputation among other dragons for being unpredictable and brash. Their temperament and tendency for violent outbursts ensure that the typical magma dragon lives a solitary life, with hatchlings often bickering or fighting to establish dominance among themselves before they leave the nest. A magma dragon always has a reason for their outbursts and can always justify their sudden turns in mood, yet they rarely feel the need to do so.
Magma dragons build lairs within volcanically active mountains or deep underground amid vast lakes of bubbling magma. As with all true dragons, magma dragons keep hoards of treasure, but the nature of their searing lairs limits the type of valuables they collect to metals, gems, and items capable of resisting the heat of a volcano's core.
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an affinity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor arcane or divine magic. Although they come from distant planes, primal dragons can be found on the Material Plane in regions touched by or reminiscent of their home plane. Although such encounters are rare, adventurers and travelers have sometimes found a brine dragon dwelling near a salty inland sea, for example, or a crystal dragon living in massive natural caverns deep in the Darklands.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient Red Dragon.
The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons are a menace to civilizations everywhere, and their strength is rivaled only by their arrogance. Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering frame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes—only unquestioned fact.
Red dragons don’t deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon’s security.
Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals—or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance.
As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous places, with volcanoes being a favorite spot, as they find them foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable. No matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and other treasures, which they zealously guard. Sometimes, the dragon’s internal heat causes these precious metals to fuse together.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient Silver Dragon.
Silver dragons are among the most chivalrous of all dragonkind; they wield frost and cold as weapons, can walk on clouds, and dwell high upon snowy mountain peaks or deep in steep, misty valleys. Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.
Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.
Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.
Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient Umbral Dragon.
While the other primal dragons hail from the Elemental Planes, the cruel and unceasingly malicious umbral dragons originate in the depths of the Shadow Plane. Their sleek black scales and serpentine grace allow them to strike from hiding, and they are known for playing with their prey before finally finishing it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.
For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Ancient White Dragon.
The most feral and least intelligent of all the chromatic dragons, white dragons are brutish, predatory, and chiefly motivated by self-preservation. Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous—in fact, it may mean the opposite. It’s nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don’t care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking—and when the attack comes, it’s bloody and relentless.
Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon’s territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility—such as tools, trade goods, and fine food—over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they’ve decorated their homes over the years.
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.

Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Animated Armor.
Suits of animated armor see use both as guardians and as training partners in high-end martial academies able to afford the extravagance. They are most often found in wizard laboratories and ancient dungeons.
Most animated objects encountered by adventurers are permanently animated creatures, either created by rituals or given life by infusions of positive energy. Restless spirits, certain ghosts, and other haunting undead influences can also give rise to animated objects, although in cases like the poltergeist, what appears to be an animated object may merely be an evil force using its magic to hurl furnishings about as weapons.
Animated objects are mindless constructs. While this leaves them no concept of the value of treasure, they are often used as guardians for vaults or repositories of valuables. In these cases, the treasures they guard can vary wildly, but should be of a value appropriate for the animated object’s level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Animated Broom.
Animated brooms perform menial tasks of cleaning and upkeep, but they can step in to defend a room from intrusion if needed. These simple animated objects can be found with greater frequency than more complicated and costly objects.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Animate Dream.
An animate dream coalesces from centuries of stray fragments of reverie and dream left behind as slumbering minds drift through the Dimension of Dreams. In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.
Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.
An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.
An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers. have been known to enslave animate dreams, forcing them to feed upon themselves. These captives break down into a fearful essence used for the hag's rituals, such as the crafting of heartstones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Animated Statue.
Animated statues are often used to guard crypts, small shrines, or areas in government buildings where they can be positioned amid normal statues to hide their true nature until an intruder arouses their ire. Adventurers’ suspicions regarding statues suddenly animating and attacking has led many less scrupulous adventurers to automatically attack any statues they encounter, ruining harmless, ancient relics.
Most animated objects encountered by adventurers are permanently animated creatures, either created by rituals or given life by infusions of positive energy. Restless spirits, certain ghosts, and other haunting undead influences can also give rise to animated objects, although in cases like the poltergeist, what appears to be an animated object may merely be an evil force using its magic to hurl furnishings about as weapons.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Ankhrav.
These horse-sized, burrowing monsters generally avoid heavily settled areas like cities, but ankhravs’ predilection for livestock and humanoid flesh ensures that the creatures do not remain in the deep wilderness for long. Desperate farmers whose fields become infested by ankhravs often have little recourse but to seek the aid of adventurers.
As if the appearance of a hungry ankhrav in a stretch of farmland isn’t bad enough, it almost always indicates the proximity of an ankhrav hive nearby. A disturbing number of ankhravs can infest a lair. However, adventurers brave enough to crawl through the tangled burrows are often rewarded with large amounts of treasure as ankhravs have a habit of dragging their victims back to the deepest corners of their den to feast, usually discarding the remains with most of the gear intact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ankou.
Ankous are shadowy killers who serve powerful fey creatures, or even the Eldest— the demigods of the First World. Amid the courts of the Eldest or of powerful fey rulers, these sinister assassins lurk overhead as they await the call to action—implied threats akin to deadly weapons hung as decor in a royal hall. Ankous never speak aloud; when they feel the need to communicate at all, they do so in a telepathic whisper directly into a victim's mind. While an ankou's body is made of strange, fleshy material, their claws and the cruel hooks on their wings are made of razor-sharp cold iron, a quality that makes them much feared among other fey. A typical ankou is 10 feet tall and has an 8-foot wingspan but weighs less than 80 pounds.
While most ankous serve powerful masters, some of these murderous fey are left to their own devices and serve none but their own capricious, cruel whims. In some cases, their master may have been slain, while in others the ankou may have been released from service for any number of reasons. An ankou left to indulge their own whims unrestrained is often the most dangerous ankou of them all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ankylosaurus.
Squat, heavily armored quadrupeds, ankylosauruses are stubborn and irascible. Although they’re herbivores, they have been known to attack other creatures that trespass within territory simply out of ill temper.
Ankylosauruses have few natural predators, as their bony hides are covered in spiked nubs that jut in many different directions to discourage larger creatures from biting them. They have mighty tails ending in an immense knot of bone, which they use to whip at threats with incredible speed and power. While these low-to-the-ground dinosaurs can trample human-sized or smaller foes, their relatively squat stance prevents them from doing so against larger targets. An ankylosaurus is about 30 feet long, 10 feet tall at the shoulder, and weighs over 3 tons.
The ankylosaurus is the largest of the heavily armored dinosaurs called ankylosaurids, but smaller versions exist as well. Still Large in size, these smaller dinosaurs, such as the 16-foot long pinacosaurus, lack the trample ability and are rarely above 4th level. Regardless of size, ankylosaurids tend to be relatively muted in coloration, with mixes of black, brown, and gray. When captive, an ankylosaurus’s keeper might paint its scales bright colors to signify to others that is not a wild creature.
While the real world fossil records hold a wealth of inspiration for the reconstruction of dinosaurs in an RPG, you can also look to living creatures for ideas. Giving a dinosaur a poisonous bite or an unusual attack routine like Clobbering Charge ensures that dinosaurs are as interesting in combat as they are in appearance.
As with most animals, dinosaurs can be tamed or domesticated, but the difficulty of this task increases along with the dinosaur’s level. Lizardfolk and orcs are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, workhorses, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In certain cities, dinosaurs are popularly featured as combatants in blood sports and other gladiatorial battles.
As animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear. Dinosaurs can also be harvested for rare and valuable trophies such as teeth, talons, armor plates, and the like.
At first glance, the inclusion of dinosaurs in a fantasy setting might seem strange, but dinosaurs are an excellent creature to use in a game that bridges the gap between familiar real-world animals and legendary monsters. If having dinosaurs mix freely with lions, manticores, and dragons still seems strange to you, consider having them dwell in remote, primeval lands, as suggested in the sidebars on pages 99–100. On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in the wilder regions of the world, particularly on the continent of Garund, though they are common enough that PCs might find some on display in a menagerie in a northern city, in use as guardian creatures, or even kept by druids as loyal animal companions.
Another classic place that dinosaurs are found in fiction are in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal place to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day‑night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam.
In a fantasy setting, magical effects or supernatural influences can enhance dinosaurs by giving them unexpected attacks, modes of movement, or other abilities. You can quickly create a memorable magical beast simply by giving a dinosaur the magical attack of another creature of an equal level, such as a spinosaurus gaining an acidic breath weapon akin to that of an adult black dragon.
A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or a quick online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well. Armor-headed pachycephalosaurs, spike-thumbed iguanodons, duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed spinosauruses, and more await discovery by those who would seek out the mysteries of the lost worlds where the thunder lizards still rule!
Dinosaurs fit well into certain types of settings. They’re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Annis Hag.
Annis hags are brutal torturers and murderers, delighting in the musical screams and tasty flesh of young creatures and those who are pure of heart. Annis hags are the most direct of all hags, engaging in physical combat and using their change shape ability to hunt rather than to infiltrate and betray humanoids. But an Annis hag takes a grisly trophy from each kill and uses it to sow discord, sending the trophy to one of her victim’s loved ones in a way that implicates another family member in the murder. Also known as iron hags, annis hags have iron-like yet flexible flesh that resists edged weapons, and their own touch is the same cold iron that burns the flesh of other hags. This allows them to bully their way to the leadership of hag covens.
Hags are dangerous enough on their own, but when they gather in threes to form covens, they grow much more powerful.
Hags loathe all humanoid races, but not equally—the brunt of their wrath is leveled against humans. Hags prey on human society the most, adding human flesh to their cauldron and snatching newborn children before replacing the babes with their own progeny as changelings.
The four types of hags presented here are but the most notorious of their kind. Others—such as the blood hag, moon hag, storm hag, and winter hag—plague society in other regions of the world.
Some believe that hags possess no true form or body of their own, but instead manifest from society’s fear of aging. That no known male hags exist has also puzzled scholars, but perhaps this is but another way in which hags mock society—by presenting themselves as awful stereotypes of elderly women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Aolaz.
Aolazes are great beasts carved from stone and metal and magically imbued with the essence of life. The exact means of their creation is a long-lost secret, and they are so rare that scholars have little opportunity to study active specimens. The best-known aolazes are museum pieces or battlefield relics destroyed or deactivated centuries ago, though fragmented records suggest that many more were made and might remain, yet to be unearthed.
Most aolazes are built in the shape of great land-bound beasts, such as elephants, rhinoceroses, or dinosaurs. Regardless of the specific creature an aolaz has been constructed to resemble, it is not bound to walk the earth like its inspirations are—it's imbued with the magical ability to pursue across water and even through the air. Few can escape an aolaz's wrath once it is earned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ararda.
<a href="Monsters.aspx?ID=213" style="text-decoration:underline">Shaitans</a> corrupted by the Black Desert's blightburn become scorpion-like arardas. While other earth genies sparkle with the iridescence of gemstones and evoke the power of the earth itself, arardas use their connection to the ground to harness the might of electricity. Arardas are so infused with this radioactive crystal that their mere presence is toxic to most living creatures.
Genies of the Black Desert do not personify the four elements of the Elemental Planes as they do elsewhere in the cosmos. Rather, blightburn genies combine their innate elemental powers with the features of the desert to summon powerful, perverted versions of natural phenomena such as electric sandstorms or acid rain.
In addition to muurfeli and arardas, other blightburn genies can also be found in the Black Desert, including black, doglike efreet called suayiks and laanums, amorphous marid-like horrors with the heads of powerful sea serpents. Darklands equivalent of jann may exist, though they supposedly only appear to the hopelessly lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Arbiter.
These spherical inevitables are scouts and diplomats. Found throughout the multiverse, they have traditionally kept watch over on chaos and its agents. With the announcement of the Convergence, many arbiters now serve as go-betweens among the aeon alliance and its mortal associates.
As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons’ war against imbalance—particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos.
Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the “Convergence.” At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons — but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How—or if—this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves.
Whether the aeons serve an actual divinity, a philosophical concept, or merely a “supreme oneness” is a topic hotly debated by planar scholars. The aeons themselves are silent, referring to this being or concept as the Monad, a “condition of all.” Regardless of what the Monad actually is, there certainly exists another category of powerful aeons—the primal inevitables, each a unique demigod with its own powers and goals. Relatively few primal inevitables remain today, for nearly three-quarters of their irreplaceable kind have fallen in the endless battle with the inexorable forces of entropy.
Aeons are among the least understood of the Great Beyond’s immortal creatures, and they have a wide range of powers and abilities. Far more aeons exist than those presented here, including guardians of time like the four-armed bythos and the weirdly symmetrical theletos, which moderates the duality between freedom and fate.
To mortals, aeons sometimes seem to combine elements that are fundamentally incompatible, whether it's an aeon combining opposing concepts, or axiomites and inevitables mixing the organic with the mathematical or mechanical. Aeons see no paradox in this, but rather claim it is an expression of the underlying unity of all things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Arboreal Regent.
Arboreal regents—also called treants—are lumbering, solitary creatures responsible for guarding an entire forest. They take an especially long view of affairs and never act brashly or without much deliberation. They occasionally come together in small groups called groves to share news and pass their wisdom down to the arboreal wardens that have sprouted under their watch. In times of grave danger, all the groves in a region may gather for a great months-long meeting to plan and, eventually, act upon a threat.
The typical arboreal regent is 30 feet tall, has a trunk 2 feet in diameter, and weighs 4,500 pounds.
Arboreals have a great respect for dead members of their species. Their elaborate burial rituals involve laying the fallen arboreal down in a mossy bed in the center of a grove of saplings. The decomposing arboreal nourishes the saplings, ensuring the growth of a new generation of trees.
Particularly old arboreal regents and other powerful arboreals can tap into the extensive network of fungus that connects the roots of all the trees in the forest. By doing so, the arboreal can learn of threats throughout the entire woodland, even from miles away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Arboreal Warden.
Arboreal wardens are the rangers of arboreal society. These itinerant folk have an innate curiosity about the woodlands in which they dwell, and rarely stop to take root and rest in the same part of the forest twice. This wanderlust makes wardens ideal forest patrollers and scouts. While they are robust combatants, they know better than to confront dangerous foes on their own. Instead, they report any dangers to arboreal regents. In rare cases, large groups of arboreal wardens congregate to form a copse. Copses travel beyond the boundaries of a forest to investigate the hinterlands and gather intelligence on potential threats before returning to report their findings. Arboreal wardens do not pretend to understand to other creatures’ motives—like most forces of the natural world, they are ambivalent about mortal affairs that do not involve their forest.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Army Ant Swarm.
An army ant swarm is a terrifying carpet of stinging insects that devours all in its path.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Asanbosam.
Asanbosams are monstrous, hairy humanoids with cold iron fangs and muscular limbs that end in powerful, hooked claws. They hide in treetops and grab prey from above, latching onto their unfortunate victims’ necks to drain their blood. Locals in nearby communities tell horror stories of these “bloodsucking tree-folk,” and experienced jungle explorers keep a close watch on the treetops in asanbosam territory.
An asanbosam’s diet calls for a large amount of iron (typically in the form of blood) to maintain the integrity of its oversized cold iron teeth. When not hunting or mating, an asanbosam spends its waking hours chewing on certain types of rocks to sharpen its teeth.
Some folk tales claim that asanbosams are as old as time and are the original source of cold iron, and that veins of the metal found in the ground are the buried graveyards of ancient asanbosams. Brave (or foolish) poachers often infiltrate asanbosam territory to hunt these monsters in the hope of collecting sacks of their valuable teeth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Assassin Vine.
The assassin vine is a carnivorous plant with a voracious appetite. Rather than consuming creatures directly, it creates its own fertilizer by entangling prey and squeezing the life from it. Once the plant has killed a creature, it pulls the carcass over to its roots to feed from the decaying flesh. Although an assassin vine lacks eyes, it can detect and track prey through a combination of using its root systems to detect vibrations through topsoil and its leaves to detect heat changes in the vicinity. Although the assassin vine has no real intelligence, its learned behaviors mimic those of cunning ambush hunters.
As it is slow moving, the assassin vine typically remains rooted in a single area for as long as it has sufficient prey. Though most often found along woodland trails or swamps, these plants can also be encountered in more rural settlements, poorly tended fields, and vineyards. While assassin vines can't be trained in the classical sense, they can be used as defenses, and woodland-dwelling creatures like goblins and fey have been known to cultivate assassin vines as guardians for less-used routes into their lairs. In such cases, the tenders often seek to make the path more obvious than its disuse would otherwise suggest, while simultaneously working to ensure the bones of the vines' victims are removed to keep their presence a secret, resulting in what appears to be an easy approach to the den but is actually an organic ambush.
Mature assassin vines grow to 20 feet long and have smaller vines extending off the main trunk that reach from to 5 to 10 feet in length. The smallest of these vines sprout every 6 inches or so; they tend to grow clusters of full leaves and occasionally bear small berries. A recently fed assassin vine can have bunches of plump, blood-red berries that are juicy and tart but leave a slightly unpleasant iron aftertaste, as if from the faint taste of blood from a bitten lip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Astradaemon (Void Daemon).
These unnerving, almost reptilian daemons represent death by direct assault against a soul or life-force—the same numbing death they bring with their fell touch. Rarely seen on the Material Plane, astradaemons spend most of their time hunting the pathways between the living world and the afterlife. There, they capture migrating souls, snatching them from their rightful rewards or punishments and dragging them to Abaddon as tribute to their undying masters. These horrifying predators of the dead can also be found stalking the banks of the River of Souls in the Astral Plane, where they constantly hunt for new victims. Psychopomps have a particular hatred of astradaemons as a result, and clashes between them and these eerie hunters of the recently departed are indeed the stuff of legend.
Not all astradaemons limit their hunt to souls. The most notorious of their kind serve the Horsemen themselves as assassins.
While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals’ fear.
While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane of pure evil for only the most corrupt souls. If Hell is a realm of torture and systematic depravity, Abaddon is its twisted cousin—a place where one can find only misery and despair in ample quantities, with neither the strictures of Hell nor the chaotic freedom of the Abyss. For evildoers who seek simply to inflict their wickedness on others, Abaddon is a rich hunting ground where one can revel in turpitude, though visitors be forewarned: the competition is fierce.
The four Horsemen are the most powerful of the daemonic demigods, but they are only four of many. Far more daemonic harbingers dwell on Abaddon, each a unique and powerful demigod in their own right that enjoys sweeping influence among daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector (ruler of the slave city of Awaiting Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian (consort to the Horseman of Famine), and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame (patron to arsonists and agent of the Horseman of War) are but three of the dozens of harbingers who rule realms in Abaddon.
Each of the four Horsemen is served by a specific category of servitor daemons known as deacons. Leukodaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Pestilence. Meladaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Famine, while thanadaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Death. Purrodaemons are currently the most powerful of the deacons, and serve the Horseman of War—yet over time, which category of deacon is the most powerful can wax and wane.
Numerous powerful and unique daemon demigods, known collectively as harbingers, rule over swaths of Abaddon. Above these demigods, though, are entities of even greater power—the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. As the eons go on, the names and identities of specific horsemen change. Currently, they consist of Apollyon (Horseman of Pestilence), Charon (Horseman of Death), Szuriel (Horseman of War), and Trelmarixian (Horseman of Famine). Of these, only Charon has never fallen to an upstart. Some hold that a “Fifth Horseman” once ruled over the other four, while others maintain that the eternally eclipsed sun in the skies above Abaddon is all that remains of this long-dead god.
As many daemons exist as there are awful ways to die. The bloody sangudaemon personifies death by blood loss, while the skeletal thanadaemon represents death from old age. The most powerful daemons are the olethrodaemons, who represent the massive deaths caused by apocalypses and the end of entire worlds.
Daemons often carry soul gems either as trophies or for powering an ability. Cacodaemons are the most common source for soul gems, but they can also be created by spells like bind soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem to power an ability, the trapped soul is released into the afterlife and can be resurrected normally.
Soul gems are traded in illicit markets, a tradition celestials and psychopomps alike find vile. Soul gems' value varies, but is generally worth an amount relative to the level of a gem's captive soul.
Daemons embody a fundamental paradox—while they are incarnations of death and seek to devour all that lives, they are themselves living creatures. Some speak of a glorious end time after which reality will finally be free of the contagion that is life itself. Most daemons give no thought to this paradox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Astral Deva (Emissary Angel).
Astral devas are the elite messengers and emissaries of the celestial realms, serving deities and celestial armies by delivering messages, performing reconnaissance, and providing support for those in need of aid. They watch over planar travelers and take powerful mortals under their wings to mentor them. Astral devas carry scrolls containing important messages and other celestial secrets.
Astral devas can form spontaneously from the souls of exceptional good-aligned mortals, but are also sometimes created from such souls intentionally by deities or demigods. In the later cases, astral devas often bear physical features that mark them as closely affiliated with that deity. An astral deva created by Sarenrae, for example, might have hair made of fire, while one created by Torag might look more dwarven, and one created by Desna could have butterfly wings instead of feathered wings. It’s not unusual for astral devas created by lawful good or chaotic good deities to share their creators’ alignment.
The most powerful angels belong to a category of demigods known as the empyreal lords—a title shared with other powerful good-aligned demigods among the host of archons, azatas, and other inhabitants of the celestial planes. The most powerful and most well-known of the angelic empyreal lords is Sarenrae.
Angels normally live on Nirvana or other celestial planes, but their missions can bring them to the Material Plane. Spellcasters can conjure them for aid or advice in times of need, and they can even be found, if rarely, crusading against fiends in Hell, the Abyss, or anywhere in between.
Many angels wear exquisite armor or wield beautiful and often magical weapons. While they are not hampered by mortal sins like greed or pride (save for the very rare and tragic exception), they do enjoy the beauty of fine clothing, exquisite jewelry, and works of art.
The most powerful angels are known as the solars, but numerous others can be found in Nirvana working their own missions or goals. Angels generally appear as beautiful, often somewhat androgynous humanoids, and the most powerful often possess two or even four sets of feathered wings.
Three types of devas exist among the angelic host, all of which serve as angelic “field agents.” Of the types of angels, devas are the ones most likely to be encountered dwelling somewhere other than Nirvana, as these angels focus their work on cultivating and protecting goodness in mortal souls, be they living or dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Athach.
The towering and brutish giants known as athaches are reviled for both their monstrosity and their cruelty. Beyond an athach's filthy habits, this giant is made stranger by the gangly third arm that protrudes from their torso and ends in a twitching, long-fingered claw. Huge, tusk-like fangs descend from an athach's upper jaw and prop their mouth open, leaking long strands of viscous drool that is itself is a toxic venom and coats the athach's fangs.
Athachs despise civilization almost as much as they despise their own kind, and they delight in committing sadistic acts and terrorizing victims. An athach does not keep a traditional territory of their own, but rather wanders the hinterlands of settled territories until they find a suitably easy settlement of smaller humanoids to target. Once the athach has chosen their target, the giant establishes a hidden lair in a location like an abandoned farmhouse or cave, and from there they launch their reign of torment. After a few weeks of harassing, capturing, and torturing victims, the athach bores of their games. The giant then goes on a final rampage, destroying every dwelling and eating every creature they can find. Sometimes, the giant allows a survivor or two to escape, forcing these terrified victims to spend the rest of their lives spreading word of the athach's fearsomeness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Attic Whisperer.
Beware the haunting sobs of the attic whisperer, for they carry the pained wrath of an abandoned child who perished due to the neglect or absence of their caretakers. Animated by loneliness, the embittered spirit binds itself to the material world in a body made of bits and oddments of a lost childhood—wooden blocks, scraps of blankets, ratty dolls, buttons, carved trinkets, and glass marbles. To give themselves the semblance of a head, they top their patchwork bodies with a small animal's skull.
Attic whisperers most frequently lurk in old infirmaries, orphanages, and other such institutions where children were forgotten, and they lay dormant for decades in hopes that they might one day find a playmate to ease their eternal loneliness. When they sense the living, attic whisperers attempt to lure them into their clutches by calling out to them using the voice of a small child. Though attic whisperers intend only to play with those they encounter, they drain the breath and voice from living creatures as their dark impulses take over.
Are we safe below?
Do you think he's listening?
Is that his shadow?
Do you hear him waking,
Up above the stairs?
Do you hear him weeping?
Is he really there?
Can you say “I'm speaking?”
Are you saying naught?
Is it you who's weeping?
Is it you he's caught?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Augnagar.
The brutish and gluttonous augnagar live to feast— preferably on rotten flesh, and when possible, demon flesh. But to them, the greatest delicacy is the flesh of other augnagars. Augnagars have spiderlike legs with leathery membranes like a bat's wings, and three tails ending in hooked claws perfect for slicing flesh.
The qlippoth presented here are but a small fraction of the squirming awfulness that lurks in the deeper rifts of the Abyss. Other types of qlippoth include multi-armed, crab-like gongorinans, which use living creatures as incubators; shapeshifting utukku, which infiltrate and undermine religions; death-spawned behimirons, which slay the living to reproduce; and the living siege engines known as catabolignes. Yet most frightening of all is the immense iathavos, a monster so abhorrent that even the Abyss cannot bear to allow more than one to exist at any one time.
Qlippoth ruled the Abyss for eons and still see themselves as its rightful rulers. When the Abyss first began to spawn demons from the souls of sinful humanoids, the realm was plunged into a brutal war spanning untold millennia, in which qlippoth, though more powerful and established, were slowly but surely driven back by the endless demonic hordes who spawned far more quickly than qlippoth could ever hope to match. Today, qlippoth have been driven to the deepest, darkest corners of the Abyss where they cling tightly to the crumbling remains of their territory.
As qlippoth lost territory to their demonic rivals, they realized that the only way to stem the tide of demonic forces was to starve them of the sinful souls that the Abyss uses to spawn new demons. While qlippoth have no concept of how they might go about preventing sin by changing the way mortals act, they do understand that exterminating mortal life would solve the problem as well.
The most powerful qlippoth are quasi-deities themselves, ancient entities only rarely worshipped by non-qlippoth. Of these monstrous divinities, the Polymorph Plague, Yamasoth, is the most well-known. Others include Chavazvug the Crawling Inferno, Isph-Aun-Vuln the Feaster Within, and Thuskchoon the Everglutton.
Although it is widely accepted that qlippoth have lost incalculable territory in the Abyss to demonkind, these fiends still control vast regions in the deepest reaches of that plane. Some sages suggest the troubling possibility that perhaps qlippoth still hold more territory of the Abyss than demons do, but because demons are more concerned with mortal life, we simply interact with the layers they control more often. For all we know, these dour sages postulate, the Abyss teems with endless swarms of qlippoth that have yet to make their move against mortal life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Augur.
These spherical knots of sinewy muscle, serrated blades, and bloody metal are the most common velstracs on the Shadow Plane. Each augur has only a single eye, from which they can see the horrors inflicted by other velstracs, who train the augur to expect and appreciate pain. Augurs are 1 foot in diameter and weigh 30 pounds.
Velstracs manifest from the souls of masochistic or sadistic mortals that are diverted into the Shadow Plane and then forged into forms that suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the aesthetics-obsessed interlocutors.
Some mortals refer to velstracs as “kytons,” a misattribution that the velstracs tolerate with cold amusement. The term “kyton” denotes a master or virtuoso among their kind, and these fiends enjoy being labeled masters of their horrid paths to perfection through agony.

Velstracs originated with the first debased thoughts of mortals, which the gods found so deplorable that they locked all velstracs away in Hell. It wasn’t long, however, before the newly formed race of velstracs escaped their infernal prison to the Shadow Plane.
Velstracs originated with the first debased thoughts of mortals, which divine beings found so deplorable that they locked all velstracs away in Hell. It wasn't long, however, before the newly formed beings escaped their infernal prison to the Shadow Plane.
Scholars grimly joke that there are as many different kinds of velstracs as there are ways to skin a cat. The relatively diminutive cantor velstrac poisons the minds of its victims so that they believe they are being clawed from the inside out. The mighty eremites, on the other hand, seek out the most powerful beings to subsume into their own form and lord over all other velstracs save the demagogues.
There are as many different velstracs as there are ways to inflict pain. Other velstracs range in power from the relatively weak lampadariuses to the powerful phylacators.
Many velstracs outsource the forging of their chains to unique velstracs known as almoners. These six-armed, legless humanoids toil endlessly at a great burning foundry called the Shadow Forge. Almoners operate under mysterious strictures, and are just as likely to turn a velstrac away empty-handed as not.
Many velstracs forge their own chains, but others outsource the task to unique velstracs known as almoners. These blind, deaf, and mute velstracs resemble six-armed halflings severed at the waist that toil away endlessly at a great burning foundry called the Shadow Forge. Almoners operate under mysterious strictures, and are just as likely to turn a velstrac away empty-handed as they are to hand one a finely crafted chain before the request has even been uttered.
The most powerful velstracs are unique divinities known collectively as demagogues—powerful creatures often worshipped by mortals who seek to experience agonizing new revelations and gain power by enhancing the body through pain.

Velstracs are most often encountered in the shadowy realm of Nidal, where the state worship of Zon-Kuthon is rigidly enforced. Indeed, many velstracs are created from the souls of Joyful Things, devotees of Zon-Kuthon who have had their limbs amputated to focus their minds on the veneration of pain, sacrifice, and torment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Aurumvorax.
Aurumvoraxes are highly aggressive and territorial predators that sprint on eight legs, using their terrific strength and iron-hard claws to dig through solid stone. A typical aurumvorax is only 3 feet long but weighs more than 200 pounds, for its thick, sturdy bones are densely packed with muscle, making the creature very strong but a notoriously poor swimmer. Its fur is golden, sometimes with a silvery or russet tone depending on the metals it has ingested, and its claws are always the shiny black of seasoned iron.
Aurumvorax adults claim hunting territories spanning a mile or more, driving out other predators and leading solitary lives except when they mate. They are irascible creatures, impossible to train as adults, but daring trainers can rear aurumvorax pups as deadly guard beasts, which they sell for hundreds of gold pieces to discriminating buyers. Aurumvorax pups are usually single births, and their mothers are fiercely protective, making their acquisition a dangerous proposition. Even when trained, the creatures are prone to dangerous bursts of rage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Avarek.
Avareks delight in tormenting ship's crews and causing shipwrecks off the coasts of Garund and the Inner Sea. Bipedal, aquatic fey covered in long, urchin-like spines, avareks stand 2 feet tall—or 3 feet tall if measured to the tips of their spines—and weigh fewer than 30 pounds.
Avareks rely on subtlety and subterfuge to indulge their destructive whims, using magic to sabotage ships and cloud the minds of crew members and passengers. Patient and cunning, avareks lurk beneath or within a targeted vessel for weeks, building conflict and mistrust. Soon, shipmates accuse one another of theft and treachery; superstitious crew members might believe their ship is haunted. Eventually, the crew becomes too frightened or mistrustful to save their ship from the avareks' sabotage.
Avareks take pride in their sunken trophies, claiming the wrecks of ships they've destroyed as their homes and gorging on the bloated, water-logged corpses of the crew and passengers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Awakened Tree.
Arboreal regents and other wielders of powerful primal magic grant temporary sentience to trees in order to protect the forest. Invested with a workable set of instincts and the ability to mobilize and attack, these awakened trees follow the commands of their master and fight to protect their home. The statistics below work just as well for foliage that has become animate via other methods, such as a mystical influence from another dimension, a capricious fey spirit, or the like.
Arboreals have a great respect for dead members of their species. Their elaborate burial rituals involve laying the fallen arboreal down in a mossy bed in the center of a grove of saplings. The decomposing arboreal nourishes the saplings, ensuring the growth of a new generation of trees.
Particularly old arboreal regents and other powerful arboreals can tap into the extensive network of fungus that connects the roots of all the trees in the forest. By doing so, the arboreal can learn of threats throughout the entire woodland, even from miles away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Axiomite.
According to the axiomites, their kind rose from the raw mathematical underpinnings of the universe, manifesting as great builders who created the ancient, colossal cities of the Outer Planes and gave life to the mechanical inevitables. According to the aeons, axiomites are part of the Monad, having both risen from and rebelled against it long ago. Since the Convergence, most axiomites have recognized this as a fundamental truth, particularly after the aeons showed the axiomites how the Utopian language has formed as an amalgam of aeon envisioning and formulaic mathematical expression. Most axiomites live in the perfect city of Axis, which they continually act to improve, thus refining the concept of perfection itself.
A particular axiomite may look like any humanoid creature, though the particular form it takes on does not affect its abilities. Beneath this assumed form, all axiomites are the same—clouds of glowing, crystalline dust that constantly swirls and congeals into complex tangles of symbols and equations, evincing their existence as literal creatures of pure mathematical law.
Axiomites arise from the souls of lawful neutral mortals, particularly those who were, in life, mathematicians, architects, crafters, or philosophers. While these souls do not retain any memories of their lives in the transition into axiomites, their life skills and experiences nevertheless serve a valuable metaphysical resource during formation.
As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons’ war against imbalance—particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos.
Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the “Convergence.” At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons — but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How—or if—this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves.
Whether the aeons serve an actual divinity, a philosophical concept, or merely a “supreme oneness” is a topic hotly debated by planar scholars. The aeons themselves are silent, referring to this being or concept as the Monad, a “condition of all.” Regardless of what the Monad actually is, there certainly exists another category of powerful aeons—the primal inevitables, each a unique demigod with its own powers and goals. Relatively few primal inevitables remain today, for nearly three-quarters of their irreplaceable kind have fallen in the endless battle with the inexorable forces of entropy.
Aeons are among the least understood of the Great Beyond’s immortal creatures, and they have a wide range of powers and abilities. Far more aeons exist than those presented here, including guardians of time like the four-armed bythos and the weirdly symmetrical theletos, which moderates the duality between freedom and fate.
To mortals, aeons sometimes seem to combine elements that are fundamentally incompatible, whether it's an aeon combining opposing concepts, or axiomites and inevitables mixing the organic with the mathematical or mechanical. Aeons see no paradox in this, but rather claim it is an expression of the underlying unity of all things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Azuretzi.
Azuretzis are sinuous, serpentine creatures with dagger-sharp teeth, covered in brilliant blue scales with mottled purple and pink highlights that shimmer in a pareidolic approximation of leering, laughing faces. The Maelstrom's chaotic forces spawn these small proteans from a variety of sources: physical mating between older azuretzis, the paradoxical promotion of bestial naunets, and possibly from mortal petitioners, though azuretzis may just be confusing putative mortal memories with experiences gained from games of mimicry. Never expect azuretzis to operate by any rational, self-consistent rules.
Azuretzis represent the humor of chaos, particularly in the form of mockery and parody via exaggerated mimicry, twisting a target's features into a laughingstock.
Proteans divide themselves into a loose caste system and possess a dizzying variety of powers. Most proteans have a serpentine body with the head of a primeval beast. Scholars have long been intrigued by this fact—that scions of dissolution and disorder would share so many features—pointing out that even in the purest chaos there is some semblance of order. Others note that the serpentine form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion and lack of consensus surrounding their kind. After all, if even chaos cannot be trusted to be chaotic, would that not be the purest form of entropy?
Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves. When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature. D8Warpwave Effect 1Clumsy 2 (3 on a critical failure) 2Confused and gains 4d6 temporary Hit Points 3Dazzled (permanent on a critical failure) 4Enfeebled 2 (3 on a critical failure) 5Immobilized by filaments of energy 6Quickened (Stride, Strike, or Step only) 7Slowed 1 8Stupefied 2 (3 on a critical failure)
Among the numerous types of immortals that dwell in the Great Beyond, the proteans are surely some of the oldest. They’ve waged war against the inevitable aeons from the advent of their first creation, and speak longingly of that time before the gods themselves imposed order upon reality.
The Maelstrom, home of all proteans, is the whirling mass of turbulent primal energy, planar waves, and soul-stuff that surrounds the Outer Planes. Planar scholars theorize that all of reality was originally formed from the Maelstrom in the early days of the cosmos—a theory proteans don’t necessarily dispute.
Where proteans go, chaos follows. To proteans, there is no purer form of existence than entropy, and they constantly seek to oppose the establishment of order in the Great Beyond. However, proteans don’t see life as being incompatible with chaos; rather, they simply believe beings—immortal or not—deserve complete freedom on their own terms.
Many other proteans beyond those presented here dwell in the Maelstrom, including the spectral pelagastrs, the nearly humanoid shapechanging ourdivars, and the incredibly powerful izfiitars.
The most powerful of all proteans are a group of demigods known collectively as protean lords. Yet even their vast might pales in comparison to that of the mysterious Speakers of the Depths. The Speakers are the most enigmatic of the Maelstrom’s gods—even their exact nature is unknown, and scholars disagree as to whether they are even divinities or just aspects of the Maelstrom itself.
Individual proteans have two names: a traditional name in their hissing, confusing language; and an honorary title. The latter is easily translated to other languages, but a protean’s traditional name can only rarely be uttered in any tongue other than Protean. As such, most proteans tend to go by their titles when dealing with outsiders, referring to themselves as, for example, “Song of Gentle Poison” or “Sibilant Cry of the Storm.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Azure Worm.
The azure worm is a deep-blue creature that is more at home in flooded tunnels than dry caves. While an azure worm is a strong swimmer, it prefers to lie in wait within the walls, door, or even ceiling of flooded caverns, ready to spring out and ambush creatures swimming past its hiding spot. The azure worm is particularly hated and feared by Darklands-dwelling cultures, due to the fact that an azure worm that burrows into a tunnel often brings with it waters from the submerged river or lake it calls home. When it becomes obvious that an azure worm is near a Darklands settlement, the inhabitants quickly establishing a hunting party to deal with the menace before it can bring ruin.
The adventure need not end simply because the party was ingloriously swallowed whole by a giant cave worm. Perhaps the PCs find an undigested item that helps them survive the inhospitable environ, or maybe the worm regurgitates them in a cavern far off from where they started. Whatever the specifics, you can easily draw from folklore and popular fiction to create your own "belly of the worm" adventure for heroes who wind up on the wrong side of the monster’s scales.
Cave worms are notoriously dim witted, driven primarily by purely animalistic needs to feed and reproduce. This hasn’t prevented attempts to use them as guardians for their lairs, if not to tame them. Magic can be used to maintain control over a worm, but gifted, patient, and brave animal trainers can condition cave worms to serve in all manner of roles, such as living siege engines, shocking methods of executing foes, or merely pets.
Some societies view the immense cave worms as natural disasters or incarnations of wrathful gods. Cave worms that have been active in a region often become part of that area’s local lore. For example, in the notorious Cinderlands of eastern Varisia, Shoanti have long told tales of Cindermaw, an immense crimson worm viewed by some as worthy of worship, and by others as the ultimate test of bravery.
Cave worms are infamous for being nearly unstoppable and for swallowing their prey whole. A cave worm also ingests earth and minerals as it tunnels. The worm processes some of these minerals, resulting in its armored hide and toxic sting, while it leaves others behind—often including treasure or other valuables that incidentally serve to lure explorers into the worm’s proximity and, more often than not, its gullet. While not completely mindless, cave worms are difficult to train, and most attempts to domesticate them (in theory, a cave worm would make an excellent mining resource) result in disaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Babau (Blood Demon).
The babau is an assassin, a murderer, and a sadist—certainly not unusual traits, yet their penchant for stealth and surprise sets them apart from their kin. Babaus form from mortal souls of lone killers—those who took pleasure in more personal murders, and particularly those with grisly patterns to their killings.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications. For planar ally, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.
The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.
The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.
Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.
When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.
The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.
The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.
While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.
Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Badger.
The typical badger has dark, brownish-gray fur highlighted with white markings, particularly on the head, giving it a striped mask of fur around its eyes. A threatened badger can swiftly become a ferocious combatant that typically fights until slain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Balisse (Confessor Angel).
Balisses, or confessor angels, seek to assist mortals ensnared by moral dilemmas or crises of faith. Balisses prefer to guide people to their own decisions rather than demand obedience to a higher cause, as intrinsic belief is even more powerful than blind obedience. While most balisses are fundamentally honest, they use their guardian angel ability to seem less intimidating and decrease the chance the mortal will simply acquiesce to the opinion of an obviously divine being. Balisses often form from souls of those who performed evil acts but were redeemed. Many serve the goddess Sarenrae, but they can serve other good deities and empyreal lords as well.
The most powerful angels belong to a category of demigods known as the empyreal lords—a title shared with other powerful good-aligned demigods among the host of archons, azatas, and other inhabitants of the celestial planes. The most powerful and most well-known of the angelic empyreal lords is Sarenrae.
Angels normally live on Nirvana or other celestial planes, but their missions can bring them to the Material Plane. Spellcasters can conjure them for aid or advice in times of need, and they can even be found, if rarely, crusading against fiends in Hell, the Abyss, or anywhere in between.
Many angels wear exquisite armor or wield beautiful and often magical weapons. While they are not hampered by mortal sins like greed or pride (save for the very rare and tragic exception), they do enjoy the beauty of fine clothing, exquisite jewelry, and works of art.
The most powerful angels are known as the solars, but numerous others can be found in Nirvana working their own missions or goals. Angels generally appear as beautiful, often somewhat androgynous humanoids, and the most powerful often possess two or even four sets of feathered wings.
Three types of devas exist among the angelic host, all of which serve as angelic “field agents.” Of the types of angels, devas are the ones most likely to be encountered dwelling somewhere other than Nirvana, as these angels focus their work on cultivating and protecting goodness in mortal souls, be they living or dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ball Python.
This nonvenomous snake’s name comes from its tendency to curl into a ball when frightened, though most people know it for its hunting tactic of coiling around prey and crushing victims with its powerful muscles. Nonetheless, brave herpetologists sometimes keep ball pythons as pets.
Snakes of all sorts eat their meals by devouring their prey whole. After incapacitating a creature, a snake unhinges its jaw and consumes the creature entirely, even if it's more than twice the diameter of the snake's body. A snake can consume a creature of the same size as itself or smaller, but most snakes are logy and sluggish while the meal digests.
Snakeskin's distinctive pattern and wide variety of applications makes it a sought-after resource, and the hides of extra-large snakes such as giant anacondas can fetch a fine price in the right market. Such oversized snake hides can be used to craft clothing of snakeskin leather, including boots and gloves, as well as other items such as scabbards, backpacks, and even tents or makeshift boats. A snake's hide can be cleanly removed with a successful Crafting check or appropriate Lore check.
Snakes appear frequently and prominently in the myths and legends of many cultures throughout the Inner Sea region. In Ancient Osirion, snakes were revered and associated both with the evil serpent god Apep and the good goddess Wadjet, the Green Empress. Perhaps the best-known example of snakes in Golarion's legends are the serpentfolk— serpentine humanoids who ruled vast swaths of the world in prehistoric times and worshipped a foul snake deity called Ydersius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Balor (Fire Demon).
When folk whisper frightened tales of the demonic, what most envision is the balor—a towering figure of fire and flesh, a horned nightmare armed with a flaming whip and a sword flying through the night in search of its latest victim. On the Abyss, balors serve demon lords as generals or captains, and they typically command vast legions of demons. Standing at 14 feet in height, only the cruelest mortal souls—those who devoted entire lives to sins too numerous to count—can fuel the formation of a balor. More often, a balor forms from a mass of dozens of mortal souls who shared debased ideologies in life. Balor Lords Those rare few balors who form from single souls are the ones most likely to eventually transcend the notable power they already wield, becoming a nascent demon lord. These balor lords are each unique creatures of 21st to 25th level in power who rule their own realm in the Abyss. In time, a balor lord can further develop into a unique creature with wildly different powers, even ascending to the role of a true demon lord.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Banshee.
Banshees are the furious, tormented souls of elves bound to the Material Plane by a betrayal that defined the final hours of their lives. Some banshees arise from elves who were slain by trusted friends and allies, or whose loved ones betrayed them on their deathbeds. Others spawn from elves whose treacherous deeds shortly before their deaths left a stain upon their souls. Regardless of their origin, banshees despise the living. This hatred of life is all too often a horrific inversion of their personalities in life. Some speculate that the more kind-hearted the elf (and the more wrenching the betrayal), the crueler the banshee.
Banshees rarely stray far from where they perished and typically haunt thick forests and canopied swamps where little light graces the ground. Many banshees can be found in the elven nation of Kyonin, specifically in Tanglebriar, the sinister domain of the demon Treerazer. Similarly, a large number of banshees can be found lurking about the edges of drow settlements in the Darklands, as plenty of cruelty and betrayal exists in drow culture.
Banshees’ mere touch inflicts pain and primal fear, and those exposed to their wails of grief rarely survive the experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Baobhan Sith.
Undeath is rare in the fey realm of the First World, for that plane's infusion with the raw power of life makes undead uncomfortable at best. Yet a few fey have adopted the vile practices and habits of notorious undead while still being living themselves, as seen in the blood-drinking habits of the murderous baobhan sith.
A baobhan sith avoids confrontations when outnumbered, and although territorial, they won't reveal their true nature to larger groups. They prefer to drink blood from victims they find attractive, and they avoid drinking blood from animals and beasts entirely, as they consider such activities to be uncultured.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Baomal.
Few sea monsters are as dreaded and feared as the two-headed baomal. These massive predatory beasts typically dwell in the deepest waters and compete with krakens and other monsters for food. They feed on whales and other large sea creatures, sometimes following them to the water’s surface. Near the surface, baomals that encounter ships quickly learn that they contain a variety of tasty morsels. The creatures use their devastating spikes to rip open the ships’ hulls, then leisurely feed on the helpless sailors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Barbazu (Bearded Devil).
Barbazus, known also as bearded devils or infantry devils, are murderous fiends who satiate their lust for annihilation by serving as the foot soldiers of Hell’s armies, often leading hordes of lesser devils such as imps and lemures into battle. Bearded devils wield serrated glaives to inflict jagged gashes that resist healing magic, resulting in tremendous blood loss. When enemies come too close, bearded devils strike with the spines of their wriggling beards to deliver a wretched contagion called Avernal fever, savoring the sight of their victim’s strength being slowly devoured from within.
Barbazus can be found savagely indulging the whims of evil infernal lords from all layers of Hell, rejoicing as they disseminate murder, misery, and anguish as they see fit.
At any one time, eight archdevils rule the eight upper layers of Hell, while the deepest layer is ruled by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a unique demigod with a dedicated role in guiding the infernal machine forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city. Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries, and Belial designs new weapons for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the oldest archdevil and keeper of many secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs armies. Baalzebul is a brooding archdevil who has fallen from Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty Mephistopheles was formed from the plane of Hell itself.
Many unique and powerful devils hold positions of power in Hell. The most numerous of these are the infernal dukes, many of whom were promoted to this position from already impressive statures as pit fiends. The supreme ruler of Hell itself is Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness. Between these two tiers rule the eight archdevils—see the sidebar on the facing page.
The nine layers of Hell are the planar home of all devils, and they much prefer its tyrannically ordered environs to anywhere else in the multiverse. Yet devils can be encountered anywhere mortals can be tempted by infernal bargains or seek diabolic aid. On Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is particularly aligned with Hell. Its government is based upon Hellʼs organization, and the state church is that of Asmodeus.
Devils view daemonsʼ constant hunt for souls as a short-sighted waste of potential, and demonsʼ chaotic destruction of society and flesh as uncivilized and obnoxious, but they do not loathe their fiendish counterparts. Indeed, most devils are more than willing to take advantage of daemons and demons as they can to further their own machinations.
Stinking, sulfurous hellfire is infused with evil. Hellfire always deals a combination of fire damage and evil damage, though the specific ratio depends on the hellfire's origin. Certain types of hellfire can impose other effects on creatures as well, such as sapping their strength or memories.
While travel to and from Hell is possible with plane shift, another way to reach and traverse the infernal realms is via hellmouths, strange living portals connecting different layers or even different planes. A hellmouth takes the form of a grimacing face, distended maw, or other distressingly organic aperture, and no two share the same appearance. Most are carefully guarded, but some new or well-hidden hellmouths have yet to be discovered.
The devils presented on these pages are a small sampling of the torments Hell has to offer. Other devils, like the inquisition-focused bone devils, the cherub-faced and fly-bodied accuser devils, and the aquatic drowning devil are a few examples of these widespread immortal creatures.
The four queens of the night wield great power in the Pit. Ardad Lili is a plotter and manipulator with ambitions of ruling the heavens, while Doloras revels in suffering. Most distant is Mahathallah, watching over fate and death. Mightiest among them is Eiseth, who is assembling an army in Dis in the hopes of claiming the iron throne of Malebolge.
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little use for compassion or empathy. As such, it exists entirely within a strict hierarchy, and this order extends to its denizens. While different types of demons correspond to various sins and daemons are associated with modes of mortal death, the different types of devils exist solely to fulfill particular roles in the infernal machine. On occasion, a particular devil can transcend the role for which they were literally shaped, but this often transforms the devil physically into the type suitable for their new role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Barghest.
Typical barghests are ravenous gluttons of life who feed and grow on the fat of mortals, their bodies changing in ways none can predict as they use the flesh and blood of their victims to achieve grisly transformations into greater barghests. Barghests often make use of their shapechanging abilities to rule tribes of goblinoids or to discreetly hunt in rural areas in the guise of unnaturally intelligent wolves. They do not work well together, as each barghest wants all the kills for itself; cannibalism is the typical result of too many barghests in one small area.
The barghest hero-gods may be the only ones of their kind capable of granting spells to their clerics, but the idea of adoring worshippers appeals to all barghests. A barghest that completes its transformation into a greater barghest, and thus is no longer morbidly distracted by its hunger, often plays the role of a deity to ignorant groups of goblins or other monsters. To them, the fact that the barghest can’t grant spells is irrelevant—rather, their veneration is due the fact that worshipping the barghest is the best way to keep it from devouring the entire tribe.
The four barghests stolen from Hell’s kennels by the deity Lamashtu were not the originals of their kind, but they were then and remain today the most powerful. Now they are denizens of the Abyss, dwelling in their own realm adjacent to Lamashtu’s domain, and are heavily worshipped by goblins across multiple worlds as “hero-gods.” These four barghests include Hadregash the slaver, Venkelvore the torturer, Zarongel the dog slayer, and Zogmugot the scavenger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Barnacle Ghoul.
Far more powerful and dangerous than most ghouls, barnacle ghouls are the risen corpses of veteran sailors who fell overboard or of bloodthirsty pirates who died from keelhauling. Too rugged and hate-filled to stay dead, these seafarers return with bluish, water-bloated bodies.
Barnacle ghouls have a supernatural command over barnacles; a simple touch from a ghoul causes the crustaceans to adhere, grow, or release. The ghouls cultivate clusters of barnacles on their hands and feet, using the lumpy shells to more easily climb and grab at prey.
Barnacle ghouls keep their lungs filled with brackish seawater, which they exhale onto their victims. Breathing in even a few drops of this tainted seawater can be deadly, as it magically expands in a victim's lungs. A creature that can't expel the seawater eventually drowns and rises as a new barnacle ghoul. Barnacle ghouls have many abilities of standard ghouls.
You can turn a living creature into a ghoul by completing the following steps. When creating a ghast, double these numerical adjustments. The monsters in this section are built from the ground up, so their numbers don't match these guidelines exactly. Custom-building ghouls is recommended if you have time, using the special abilities listed here but creating the other statistics to match what you want the ghoul to be. First, increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. Increase its AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If the creature is limited in how often it can use an ability (such as a breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.
A ghoul gains the undead and ghoul traits, and it usually becomes evil. If the base creature has any abilities that come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghoul. All ghouls gain the following abilities. The save DC for all abilities uses the DC of the ghoul's level.
Darkvision
Negative Healing
Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious
Claws If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus paralysis). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.
Jaws If the creature had a mouth, it gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus ghoul fever and paralysis). The damage amount should be the same as the creature's non-agile attacks.
Consume Flesh (manipulate) Requirements The ghoul is adjacent to the corpse of a creature that died within the last hour. Effect The ghoul devours a chunk of the corpse and regains 1d6 Hit Points plus 1d6 for every 2 levels it has. It can regain Hit Points from any given corpse only once.
Ghoul Fever (disease) Saving Throw Fortitude; Stage 1 carrier with no ill effect (1 day); Stage 2 2d6 negative damage and regains half as many Hit Points from all healing (1 day); Stage 3 as stage 2 (1 day); Stage 4 2d6 negative damage and gains no benefit from healing (1 day); Stage 5 as stage 4 (1 day); Stage 6 dead, and rises as a ghoul the next midnight.
Paralysis (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) Any living, non-elf creature hit by a ghoul's attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or become paralyzed. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.
Swift Leap (move) The ghoul jumps up to half its Speed. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Basidirond.
The basidirond, also called a mindfrond, is a fungal creature that crawls about on woody tendrils. The large, bowl-shaped pod atop its body collects mineral-rich moisture—-whether runoff from cave walls or fresh blood—-for sustenance. It uses hallucinogenic spores to incapacitate prey long enough for it to beat its prey to a bloody pulp, then deposits the deliciously tenderized remains into this pod for consumption. A basidirond is over 6 feet tall and 3 to 4 feet wide, and weighs nearly 300 pounds when saturated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Basilisk.
The basilisk is an eight-legged reptile with a nasty disposition and the ability to turn creatures to stone with its gaze. Folklore holds that, much like for the cockatrice, the first basilisks hatched from leathery eggs laid by snakes and incubated by roosters, but little in the basilisk’s physiology lends any credence to this claim.
A basilisk prefers to eat petrified flesh. Once a victim has been turned to stone, the basilisk crunches the fossilized corpse with its powerful jaws and lets its potent stomach acids do the rest. This digestive process is extremely slow and inefficient, causing the basilisk to move so lethargically that it appears as if in mid-petrification itself. This has even led to the saying “as slow as a well-fed basilisk.” Certainly basilisks are well-known for their slow gait and slothful nature, but a predator that can turn its prey to stone with a glance hardly has much need for speed.
An adult basilisk is 13 feet long from head to tail and weighs roughly 300 pounds. These reptiles make hissing sounds when moving about that turns to a guttural gurgle when they’re agitated. Though they are normally solitary creatures that come together only to mate and lay eggs, there are periodic reports of regions being infested with unusual numbers of basilisks. What causes these unusual congregations of basilisk activity is unknown.
For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk’s stare, and they sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume eggs or freshly hatched young. Some legends suggest that a basilisk’s blood can transmute common stones into other material, but this is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of previously petrified creatures or body parts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bastion Archon.
The mightiest of archon-kind form in the heat of battle from incredibly uncommon circumstances. When a gathering of lantern archons converges into a gestalt in order to defend allies in a fight that seems all but lost, a fellow archon of significant strength—such as a star archon—can commit a brave act of self-sacrifice by dimensionally transposing itself with the gestalt. If the circumstances are just right and luck is with the archons, the result is not a glorious sacrifice, but instead the earth-rocking emergence of a bastion archon. In this way, the lowliest of archons—the lanterns—can, in an instant, become their kind's greatest hope.
Bastion archons are massive beings made of the very stone of Heaven's Holy Mountain, with their visages obscured by a blinding light surrounding the gestalt that originally formed the bastion. Tireless in their embodiment of the virtue of sacrifice, a bastion archon almost always protects the area where they manifested, and even when they are destroyed they leave an indelible mark of righteousness upon the surrounding region.
Archons live in the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven. They manifest in the Garden at the mountain’s peak from mortal souls who answer a mysterious voice. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms. Intensely orderly in their metamorphosis, new archons begin as lantern archons or other lesser forms, transforming into ever-greater archons as their virtue and achievements grow. Each archon represents a particular virtue, such as hope, charity, justice, or courage, and they gain strength in the presence of mortals who exemplify this virtue. Due to their extremely lawful nature, archons sometimes find themselves at odds with azatas.
While archons do not seek to gather or maintain wealth, they do appreciate beauty and art, and their domains are often decorated with valuable crafts and creative works. Their armor and weapons are similarly ornate, and they always clean and polish their gear after battle. Archons value order—and thus tidiness—in all things.
As with angels and azatas, the most powerful of archons are a caste of demigods known collectively as empyreal lords. Each archon empyreal lord is a unique and powerful creature that keeps a domain somewhere in Heaven and is worshipped on Material Plane worlds. Archon divinities serve a variety of goals and focus on different aspects of righteousness. Some, such as Zohls, hold influence over the pursuit of truth and determined investigations, while others, like Damerrich, the demigod of executions, emphasize the punishment of unrepentant wrongdoers and seek to obliterate evil in all its forms.
When a spirit becomes an archon, they usually start as a lantern archon, the lowliest of archonkind. As they perform noble deeds and bolster their pureness of heart, an archon evolves into greater forms, possibly skipping stages or remaining in others for long spans of time, depending on their particular strengths and personality.
While commonly found in Heaven, archons can also be encountered on the fiendish planes in their endless crusade against evil. On the Material Plane they are usually encountered as advisors or saviors to those in need.
Always ready to defend others, most archons are never encountered out of their suits of armor. Even those who eschew armor, such as the bastion archon, tend to still appear as if they are wearing heavy protection against the scourge of battle.
Archons reside in Heaven, a plane that appears as a single massive mountain. Heaven is broken into seven tiers, with most archons occupying the second level and base of army operations, Proelera, or the sixth level, Iudica, the administrative heart of Heaven.
Many other archons than those presented here patrol Heaven or crusade in the fiendish planes, including the resolute hound archon soldiers and sentinels, and the supreme bastion archons, who rank among Heaven’s most powerful defenders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bebilith.
While demons control much of the Abyss, even they are hunted in the wilder regions of this horrific plane. The most notorious of these predators—though not the deadliest—is the bebilith. These fiends resemble elephant-sized spiders with glowing eyes, barbed chitin, and a fanged maw dripping caustic fluid.
Many demons and planar travelers have underestimated bebiliths' devious intellects, believing them to be little more than oversized vermin. Bebiliths take advantage of this, ambushing foes with unexpected tactics. While they lash out at any creatures they encounter, they take great pleasure in chewing on demonic flesh. Qlippoth are the only creatures bebiliths never consume.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Behemoth Hippopotamus.
Behemoth hippopotamuses stand taller than elephants. They spend less time out of water than their smaller kin. Behemoth hippos are omnivorous, and many enjoy the taste of meat.
A hippopotamus's sweat is an unusual reddish color that can lend them an even more frightening appearance that evokes the visage of a blood-coated monster. This sweat helps to protect the hippopotamus from becoming overheated, but it also bolsters their resistance to all manner of diseases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Behir.
The behir is a massive, serpentine beast with never fewer than a dozen short legs, each ending in three hooked talons. A behir can live to 80 years, but most perish far younger to violence. Fully grown, a behir is 40 feet long and weighs 4,000 pounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Belker.
These reclusive elementals have glowing red eyes, leathery wings, and long, sharp claws. While they always retain their shape, belkers can control the solidity of their forms at will, transforming into clouds of smoke, ash, and dust.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bida.
Bidas are black-scaled dragons with long, serpentine bodies and bat-like wings. Their legs and claws are smaller than those of most dragons, but their powerful undulating coils, like those of a boa constrictor, are potent weapons capable of squeezing the life from several unfortunate victims at a time.
A bida uses its impressive intellect and powerful magic to pose as a humanoid and infiltrate a settlement. Over the course of weeks or months, it establishes itself as a key member of the village, and only after it has become invaluable to the community does it reveal the terrible price of its assistance: regular offerings of flesh and gold. From this point on, the bida dwells almost exclusively within its smoggy lair, growing fat off the blood of its sacrificial offerings. To hide its presence from the outside world, a bida conceals its enslaved settlement in a large-scale illusion, leaving only a stand of jungle trees where once a thriving village may have been and ordering the townsfolk to destroy any roads in and out of town.
Bidas begrudgingly tolerate others of their kind, instead preferring the company of their small, tasty thralls. In rare cases, a pair of bidas may join forces to conquer a particularly large settlement, extracting that much more wealth (and blood) from the populace as a result of their partnership.
Bidas, like most dragons, are fond of treasure, particularly gold, and their hordes are spectacular to behold. Although the wealth in a bida’s cave belongs to the unfortunate villagers the bida has intimidated into servitude, many victims would willingly relinquish their claims to items to convince a party of dragon slayers to eliminate the tyrannical monster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Biloko Veteran.
A biloko who has led a sufficient number of successful hunts garners the respect (and fear) of their companions.
A biloko looks like a slender but wiry humanoid with a head resembling a crocodile’s, rust-colored skin, and blood-red eyes. It eats only the meat of humanoids, though it can survive for extended periods of time on a single meal thanks to its snake-like ability to consume a typical Medium humanoid creature whole, which it does by unhinging its jaws and slowly swallowing the victim from head to foot. Thanks to its acidic saliva and sharp teeth, a biloko can masticate its food into an easy-to-digest pulp, grinding flesh and bone into a compact mush, even while swallowing, and does not flinch while devouring meals two or three times its own size. A biloko that has recently fed is easily recognizable by its distended belly, though the fey is no less dangerous then, as it delights in killing and might have hungry comrades hiding among nearby.
Bilokos’ connection to the First World grants them a limited ability to supernaturally charm their enemies. Bilokos use this power to lure stragglers away from their adventuring parties or confuse their opponents when a raid goes horribly awry. Large hunting parties of bilokos might charm entire groups of travelers, in which case these bilokos might bring their enchanted quarry back to their tribe to feast on (though they are more likely to simply enjoy the spoils of their efforts alone).
Bilokos prefer to move about in small, stealthy packs in dark, isolated sections of the jungle. When a band of bilokos finds a suitable hunting ground, it claims the area exclusively, digging pit traps, crafting snares from vines, and building blinds high in trees where the predators can lie in ambush.
In the jungles north of Lake Ocota, rumors speak of an incredibly powerful eloko who calls himself Emperor Sharptooth and rules over an entire city of bilokos and other fey. While such coordination between the capricious fey is not unheard of, explorers have been unable to verify these stories, as all who attempt to find the biloko settlement are never seen again. Recently, a group of Pathfinders based out of Nantambu has started collecting funds for an expedition to find this mysterious city and return with information (and possibly a wealth of treasure).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Biloko Warrior.
Rank-and-file bilokos stalk the jungles in small hunting bands.
A biloko looks like a slender but wiry humanoid with a head resembling a crocodile’s, rust-colored skin, and blood-red eyes.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Binumir.
Whenever two individuals who share a strong emotional bond perish together, they might rise as a combined spirit known as a binumir. The two individuals' souls partially merge into a singular entity, though each one feels a constant longing for the other. This curse causes a binumir great distress and envy, leading the creature to lash out and attack others. Only the destruction of the binumir will liberate the two spirits and finally give them peace.
Binumirs commonly appear in places where people die sharing their last moments together, such as in settlements hit by natural disasters. The two spirits of a binumir are distinct. Each half retains the visage of the respective individual that died to later form part of the creature. The spirits typically appear holding hands, but they constantly search for each other. They cry and weep for their lost loved one, unable to recognize the other's presence right beside them.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Black Bear.
Contrary to the name, black bears can be cinnamon or even blond in coloration, depending on which hue is most beneficial for surviving in their local environment. Regardless of their coloration, they are opportunistic eaters who gain sustenance from berries and nuts just as often as from fish and smaller mammals. They steal food when they find it, including from humanoid camps. Although they are predators, black bears are more timid than other bears. Unless defending themselves or their young, black bears often avoid conflict or fight only until they can retreat.
A bear den can contain valuable treasures, such as the remains of less fortunate adventurers who stumbled into a hungry bear’s path. Bear furs themselves are valued as rugs, while their claws and fangs make for impressive jewelry or adornments for armor. Bear hide is an excellent resource for hide armor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Black Pudding.
Most often found below ground, these oozes scour caves for objects to dissolve with their corrosive secretions. This caustic acid is particularly dangerous to creatures that attack a pudding, as it can quickly damage and destroy gear.
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms are usually found near each other, as the two oozes are part of the same life cycle. When a giant amoeba grows large enough, it can spontaneously split apart into two separate amoeba swarms, and when an amoeba swarm feeds enough, its individual components can fuse together into a single creature.
Many oozes have acidic attacks that can quickly degrade flesh, wood, and even stronger materials. Some believe that oozes are the result of alchemical or magical experimentation run amok, while others postulate that they simply emerged from the natural processes of evolution.
Many varieties of these nearly mindless predators exist in the world. Some are mere variants, with different colored puddings, jellies, and oozes with little to differentiate them from those presented here other than their habitat. Others are more specialized, or even dangerously intelligent. The shoggoth is one such example, but another variety of deadly and powerful ooze is the thankfully rare blight, a creature composed of protoplasm and eyes that curses entire regions with its presence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Black Scorpion.
With a carapace the color of polished obsidian and a penchant for attacking villages, this humongous scorpion is one of the desert's most frightening predators. A black scorpion measures 60 feet from tip to the base of its stinger.
While scorpions are often symbols of death or evil, their venom can be extracted and used for a wide variety of medical applications. A character can milk an incapacitated giant scorpion to extract raw scorpion venom, which can be used as raw materials to craft giant scorpion venom or lesser antiplague. To determine the value of ingredients you gain each day and the DC of the appropriate Medicine or Lore check, use the level 3 task entry in Table 4–2: Income Earned.
Those rescued from death in the burning sands often recount the same dying vision: a strange, silver-eyed woman whose scarlet silk tents stand on the back of a colossal black scorpion, riding out of a shattered city and leading an army of the dead across a sea of glass toward the world of the living. Millennium-old paintings on the walls of rediscovered tombs depict a similar desert rider. The identity of this red-robed woman is unknown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Blindheim.
Inhabitants of damp, subterranean caves, blindheims resemble stubby humanoids with oversized, frog-like heads and bulbous eyes. Their eyes emit a soft glow at all times, but a blindheim can draw back the heavy membrane that normally covers them to emit an intense light as bright as day. These simple creatures use their lights to draw in or disorient prey, mostly small animals like lizards, rodents, or fish. However, they might go after larger prey if trying to feed their young. When they encounter creatures their own size or larger they retreat, flashing their eyes to facilitate their escape if necessary. They often hunt in pairs or small packs. Using their lights to coordinate from a distance, they slowly close in on the creatures they hunt. One common hunting pattern involves one blindheim diving deep and using its light to chase fish to the surface, while another up above snatches them up and tosses them onto the land to eat later.
Blindheims make their nests in damp caverns, especially grottoes next to underground lakes or bogs. An ideal nest rests in a cozy cavern with plenty of fungus to eat, a few fish swimming in a lake, and the comforting drip of water from the ceiling. Blindheims prefer to lead quiet and serene lives, and even when first born they emit only the meekest of vocalizations. A blindheim is born shining, and its parents cuddle over it to dim the light so as to avoid attracting predators.
It's not just animals that endanger blindheims. Underground peoples find the creatures useful and attempt to capture them for specialized purposes. Duergars use them as “raid frogs,” placing heavy hoods over blindheims' heads and revealing them suddenly during raids to blind their foes. They sometimes send the creatures along with their slaves that lack darkvision into the mines as a source of light. Drow use them for some of these same purposes, and some nobles have been known to treat the creatures as mere lanterns, having them hoisted to the ceilings of their halls. Neither duergars nor drow take good care of the captive creatures, so blindheims rarely last long in captivity.
Two Quick Flashes: Danger!
Long Pulse: All is safe.
Two Long Pulses: Captured food.
Very Long Pulse: Come here.
Rapid Strobing: Let's mate!
Intermittent Quick Flashes: Excited!
One Long Flash, then Darkness: Sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Blink Dog.
At first glance, blink dogs seem to be little more than long-eared, bearded canines with tawny coats. Yet their intelligent eyes and the blue nimbus of energy that dances across their fur hint at not only the blink dog's inherent intelligence, but also of their connection to the occult energies and mysteries that hide beyond the sight of the untrained eye. These honorable creatures are as intelligent as most humanoids. They live and hunt in large packs, roaming forests, plains, and the hidden places of the world in hunt for evil creatures—particularly those that dwell in the depths of the Ethereal Plane.
Unless acting in concert with specific allies who have proven that their goals are shared, blink dogs tend to avoid other creatures if at all possible. Their packs are constantly on the move and hidden from those that would seek them out. But in times of need, they have been known to come to the rescue of villages and lost travelers. While they have no innate ability to travel to the Ethereal Plane for extended periods of time, all blink dogs constantly shimmer and ripple between the Material Plane and the Ethereal. They do their best to use their ability to blink to snatch glimpses into the Ethereal Plane and keep track of potential threats that might be building there, but in practice this tactic yields more of a constant stream of hunches and estimations of Ethereal-based threats. Of course, to a blink dog, this constant state of flux is as natural as breathing.
Pack leadership always falls to a pair—an elder blink dog (called an alpha) who relies upon the valued guidance of a trusted pack mate (the sage). Honor and tradition are keystones of blink dog society. They are fiercely loyal, defending the pack or creatures they befriend to the death and maintaining oaths handed down from litter to litter. Though different packs hold different traditions and oaths, their connection through the tales and stories told among their kind and the shared experience of the movement of stars above weave all blink dogs into an extended family, a great pack. Through their myths and folklore, blink dogs have names for celestial phenomena, note births under auspicious stars, and read omens from unusual stellar conjunctions. These celestial signs are woven into blink dogs' lifeways; their names contain a reference to the specific constellation under which they were born, and a pack's sage watches the heavens for signs to help them decide when a pup is old enough for their first hunt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Blizzardborn.
Freezing and thawing in a near-constant loop, blizzardborn resemble humanoid forms composed of a mixture of partially melted snow and sleet. These elementals move with crunching strides, their bodies constantly sloshing and sloughing off shards of ice. Because of their ability to refreeze, blizzardborn can travel into warmer environments safely, though they tend to look more like slush in these areas.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Though fire and water classically oppose one another, in the right mixture they can become a dangerous combination. Water elementals heated to a scalding temperature through natural factors such as underwater volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent fire damage with their Strikes, while fire elementals infused with moisture might exude clouds of obscuring or even blinding steam.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Blodeuwedd.
The mysterious blodeuwedds dwell in those parts of the world where the boundaries between the Material Plane and the First World have worn thin, or around portals between the two planes. Their link with such regions of the natural world is so strong that it rivals the bond shared between nymphs and places of great natural beauty, yet none would look upon a blodeuwedd and mistake them for something as elegant as a nymph.
Although blodeuwedds share certain traits with nymphs, their role as guardians of the pathways between this world and the First World prevents them from forming as powerful a magical bond with the natural world. Never truly a part of either reality yet forced to keep watch over both, blodeuwedds tend to grow cynical and sharp-tongued toward any who would seek travel from one realm to the other, regardless of their actual goals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Blood Boar.
Blood boars are fearsome swine bred in Cheliax for the singular purpose of hunting down escaped slaves. The species originated from a type of large feral boar native to Nidal’s shadowy Uskwood, and blood boars retain their predecessors’ gray fur, red eyes, and exceptional senses. The intensive breeding process to produce blood boars—augmented by the selective application of magic—grants the creatures an unparalleled awareness of blood, including the ability to precisely detect a bloodied creature’s location and movements, allowing the boars to track their prey from up to a mile away.
Blood boars’ keepers groom and mark the animals to enhance their already unsettling appearance. While from a distance, a blood boar might be mistaken for an ordinary pig, up close the differences are stark. Blood-red eyes, ashen fur, and unnaturally sharp tusks frame hundreds of pounds of raw muscle, the veins of which can be seen through the boar’s ghastly pale flesh. Chains, manacles, and spikes are typical blood boar accessories, ensuring the boars are as fearsome as possible.
A blood boar’s ability to track its quarry using only the scent of the target’s blood has been the bane of many thieves, brigands, and the occasional illicit lover, but none have as much cause to fear the beasts as slaves in pursuit of freedom. Even washing off spilled blood does nothing to deter the blood boar’s pursuit if it already has the scent. As a result, many halflings in the Bellflower Network zealously practice disarming and nonlethal combat techniques specifically to avoid accidental bloodshed during an escape.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bloodlash Bush.
What first appears to be a simple shrub suddenly stirs to life.
The bloodlash bush attempts to lacerate its foes, using its weeping wounds to irrigate the ground around itself. The seeds of a bloodlash bush can take root only in soil that has been soaked in blood.
These deadly organisms can be found in any hot or temperate environment, but like most plants, they need light and moisture to thrive.
While most forms of deadly flora do not value treasure in any way, their victims' wealth can usually be found strewn about their location, sometimes even buried in their roots. Due to the outdoors, the only things of value that are typically found are made from metal or stone, like weapons, armor, and some talismans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Blood Ooze.
Swelling like a bubble about to burst, this oozing thing looks like it is made entirely from blood. Its slick, crimson skin is marred only by spots that look like clots formed on the surface.
Created through the foulest of alchemical rituals, the blood ooze seeks only one thing: to increase its mass by consuming blood from the living. The blood ooze hides within the body of its victims, only bursting out to attack when another meal draws near, leaving the body a husk of its former self.
The process by which such an ooze is created involves draining the blood of at least four Medium creatures and feeding all of the collected blood to a fifth creature, along with deadly reagents designed to prevent the blood from coagulating. During this time, the host slowly dies while the blood ooze takes form, emerging 2 to 6 hours later. Blood oozes have no loyalty toward those who created them, but some creators have noted that newly formed blood oozes seem to avoid harming other members of the host creature’s family.
It is not widely known that an existing blood ooze can reproduce by splitting itself in half. It undergoes this division only if it has grown so large that splitting in half would create a pair of normal-sized blood oozes, such as the one listed below.
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms are usually found near each other, as the two oozes are part of the same life cycle. When a giant amoeba grows large enough, it can spontaneously split apart into two separate amoeba swarms, and when an amoeba swarm feeds enough, its individual components can fuse together into a single creature.
Many oozes have acidic attacks that can quickly degrade flesh, wood, and even stronger materials. Some believe that oozes are the result of alchemical or magical experimentation run amok, while others postulate that they simply emerged from the natural processes of evolution.
Many varieties of these nearly mindless predators exist in the world. Some are mere variants, with different colored puddings, jellies, and oozes with little to differentiate them from those presented here other than their habitat. Others are more specialized, or even dangerously intelligent. The shoggoth is one such example, but another variety of deadly and powerful ooze is the thankfully rare blight, a creature composed of protoplasm and eyes that curses entire regions with its presence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bloodseeker.
Scourges of swamps and damp, abandoned places, bloodseekers are ravenous blood drinkers. Farmers curse the creatures for sucking their livestock dry. It is from such beleaguered people that the bloodseeker’s regional name “stirge,” possibly a corruption of the word “scourge,” comes. Folk wisdom holds that the appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven’t been properly tended to. Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers aren’t hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods thorps even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal “tools” to drain away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshippers of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their faith and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies, those who accidentally give too much are considered to have been “blessed” by the village’s hungry god.
Bloodseekers seem to be constantly hungry, but they are not inherently malevolent. They can be scared away fairly easily and prefer to swiftly retreat rather than risk death. Some adventurers report that these creatures can be scared away by waving torches at the flying pests. However, bloodseekers are much bolder when encountered in larger numbers, as bringing down one victim lets an entire colony feed. Bloodseeker colonies are called clots, for obvious and disgusting reasons. If a lone bloodseeker finds a likely victim while its clot is nearby, it emits a high-pitched, keening noise to summon reinforcements.
Most humanoids avoid bloodseekers, but boggards sometimes cultivate bloodseeker nests around the perimeter of their territory. These colonies serve as a deterrent to intruders, and the boggards sometimes check for bloodseeker prey, collecting the hides or bodies of animals killed by the pests. Meals prepared from slain bloodseekers that have gorged on the blood of specific creatures are a staple among certain boggard communities. The boggards not only eat the actual bloodseekers, but they also make a gelled slurry from the drained blood.
A typical bloodseeker is about a foot long, with mottled, reddish-brown skin and a yellow underbelly. Its four wings resemble bat wings. When gorged with blood, the creature becomes bloated and pink, and it tends to wobble unsteadily in the air as it ies off to digest its meal.
Bloodseekers have no interest in treasure, but their lairs tend to be scattered with the remains of adventurers—and their valuables.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Blue-Ringed Octopus.
While relatively small, the blue-ringed octopus is particularly venomous for its size.
The octopuses presented here are smaller versions of the much larger giant octopus, but other species exist as well. The brightly colored seafire octopus occupies a predatory niche somewhere between the reef octopus and giant octopus—its bite injects a venom that causes a painful rash and nausea. The immense grisly octopus is among the largest of its kind. It can swallow humans whole and can squirt particularly sticky crimson ink to incapacitate prey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Boar.
Boars are omnivorous mammals, hunted heavily because their meat is considered a delicacy. Boars are most likely to attack humanoids either in self-defense or during their mating season in the winter months, when the males grow an extra inch of tissue to protect their organs as they fight off rivals. Of course, in some cultures boars are trained to become much more aggressive so they can fill the roles of warbeast and guardian. When such boars escape back into the wild, they can become true terrors of the region.
Boars can be found in almost any environment, from forests to deserts, warm or cold, including even high-altitude mountainous regions. They tend to prefer forests, marshes, and meadows. Daeodons are likewise found in such regions but generally prefer remote reaches far from civilization.
A boar's carcass typically provides enough meat for 100 meals or more, as well as hide and bristles that can be used for crafting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bodak.
When a living, sentient humanoid is exposed to an extreme expression of supernatural evil, the experience can irrevocably damn the victim, crushing their mind and ripping out their soul in an appalling, unholy transformation that results in a creature that's anathema to life—the bodak.
The shreds of physicality that survive this absolute corruption serve only to enhance the humanoid's profoundly disturbing appearance. The bodak's body is horrifically twisted, as though it's locked in a convulsion of agony and terror. Its desiccated and hairless flesh bears an otherworldly, pearlescent sheen, strung taut across a malformed skeleton that reduces its gait to a slow shamble. But most disturbing of all are its eyes, set in a drooping, melted visage with scant remains of its former facial structure. These eyes, sunken deep into their sockets, nevertheless glow with an unholy light, stare with unremitting malevolence, and constantly weep noxious vapor.
Fragmented memories of a prior existence filtered through a vengeful hatred of the living lead the bodak to try to return to those places it once knew. If successful, it assaults former friends, acquaintances, and loved ones with its murderous gaze and an incomprehensible torrent of gibberish laced with vile curses, accusations, and threats—an assault that often leads to the victims rising as newly formed bodaks themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bogey.
A bogey typically hunts a single creature at a time, usually a small child or elderly person, methodically stalking and tormenting their prey. Often hiding under a bed, amid a dark attic space, or in a closet left slightly ajar, the bogey delights in the slow, methodical cultivation of fear in its victims.
While bogeymen stem from bugaboos and bugaboos from bogeys, it is unknown where, exactly, bogeys come from. If superstitious storytellers are to be believed, then bogeys arise from the unfortunate victims kidnapped by bogeymen. According to these tales, victims go missing for months or even years before returning as bogeys to the town they once called home.
Bogeymen and their lesser kin delight in instilling fear in small communities where gossip can quickly amplify their shadowy deeds. In such locales, bogeymen use peoples’ natural tendency to spread misinformation to sow discord and escape notice—for who would rightfully believe that an actual bogeyman is behind the latest murder?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bogeyman.
These nocturnal stalkers tail their chosen quarry for days, even weeks at a time, ominously showing up in back alleys, shadowy street corners, and even in victims’ own homes before going in for the kill. For unfathomable reasons, a bogeyman may spare a victim’s life and instead kidnap them, absconding to a far-off location before returning years later with a fresh bogey in tow.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Boggard Scout.
Often tasked with patrolling the borders of their lands, boggard scouts learn to speak another language (typically Common) to make it easier to issue threats and insults toward trespassers.
Boggards prefer to dwell in swamplands and mires. Though they are at home in the water, they prefer to spend most of their lives on land, and build villages of mud huts. They often keep guardian beasts, such as bloodseekers, crocodiles, giant frogs, or other feral animals tamed (if only just barely) to serve as protectors.
The shell of a giant snapping turtle is over 20 feet long and is sturdy, naturally curved, and waterproof, making it a useful building material. While boggards seldom have advanced construction techniques, they use giant snapping turtle shells as roofs and rafts when available. Boggards also incorporate smaller turtle shells into their armor.
Gogunta is the patron of the boggard people, many of whom worship her as their goddess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Boggard Swampseer.
The boggard swampseer has been gifted with magic through its worship of the demon lord Gogunta, and uses its power to rule a boggard village, keeping the rest of the village in line and planning raids on nearby communities.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Boggard Warrior.
Boggard warriors exalt in single combat, and prefer to fight alone so that none can contest their kills. They have been known to pursue enemies who flee combat with a single-mindedness that seems almost supernatural.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Bog Mummy.
The cultural practice of mummifying the dead is not the only way a body can become preserved, nor is it the only route that gives rise to these disease-spreading undead monstrosities.
Bog mummies (also called peat mummies or mire mummies) rarely, if ever, leave their marshy realms. Less powerful than their more notorious artificially preserved kin, bog mummies are preserved not by agents introduced during rituals but by the natural elements present in the airless, acidic morass of a peat bog or muddy swamp. While corpses preserved in this manner can certainly rise from the mire as bog mummies as the result of a curse by fell powers or the directed influence of a necromancer, the vast majority of them animate from a seething need for vengeance or to pursue some dire agenda left unfinished at the time of death—often because the creature was slain or otherwise betrayed. The nature of this emotional tie to life and the emotional power of the deceased compel unlife beyond death, while the preservative qualities of the bog within which the body was disposed of does the rest.
Although most bog mummies are motivated by vengeance, many fulfill their dark yearnings with general violence. Filled with wrath and hatred for the living, they mercilessly attack any living creatures that dare to venture into their dismal domains. Their agonized moans echo over their putrid homes, driving away most natural life dwelling therein and often alerting travelers to the potential danger that lies beneath the surface.While many cultures practice mummification of the dead for benign reasons, undead mummies are created through foul rituals, typically to provide eternally vigilant guardians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bog Strider.
The insectile bog striders call themselves seshes, but they take no offense at those who use the more common vernacular to refer to them. They resemble upright water striders with four legs, two arms, and powerful mandibles. Bog striders can move about on water like solid ground, chasing down prey or fleeing from predators across the water. They rarely leave the swampy rivers and lakes they call home. Bog striders stand 5 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.
A bog strider's diet consists almost entirely of meat, but they prefer to feed only on animals, as they consider the consumption of the flesh of any sapient creature a taboo.
In sesh society, each individual is expected to serve equally in all efforts to ensure the society's survival against the more aggressive creatures often found in or near their swampland homes. In addition, each member of the community is expected to develop a skill that contributes to the community's prosperity, and by extension, the continued survival of the species. Traditionally, female bog striders are builders and artisans while males are hunters and gatherers, but often such roles aren't limited to a single gender, as every member of a small community pitches in to help as they can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bone Croupier.
For many, gambling is just fun and games, but for some, it can become a bad habit or even a life-consuming addiction. Bone croupiers take the meaning of “life-consuming” to its literal extreme. Undead gamblers whose lust for cards and dice couldn’t be sated in life, they haunt the shadowy corners of gambling halls and continue their search for that next hit of adrenaline.
In undeath, gaming takes on a different flavor; with nothing left to lose, bone croupiers turn their attentions toward others, cajoling and palavering normally casual gamers into committing themselves to ever higher stakes. Before they know it, these unsuspecting victims have called in decades-old favors and put liens on their homes in the hope of winning back just a fraction of the pot. But by then the bone croupier has already claimed its prize—for to this undead chiseler, any earnings are incidental, and the real prize is encouraging others to lose their own.
Bone croupiers often enshroud themselves in thick layers of cigar smoke or voluminous robes to mask their undead nature, but they almost always wear wicked grins at the table. This smile is no ruse or part of its poker face, however—the truth is that bone croupiers truly delight in games, regardless of whether they are winning or losing, and despite their incredible skills of deception and trickery, most simply can’t disguise their unbridled mirth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bone Prophet.
The speakers for the dead known as bone prophets hold an esteemed place as voices for their decapitated god. Burial rites, necromantic rituals, and the delivery of cryptic utterances supposedly whispered to them by Ydersius all fall under the dominion of these priests. Bone prophets often raise fallen aapophs as skeletons.
Today, the central realm of the Darklands retains the old name of the serpentfolk empire that once dominated this region—Sekamina. This name is also the source of the serpentfolk’s Aklo title, sekmin, which they are often called in ancient texts. Sekamina itself retains very little of the serpentfolk’s legacy, its mantle of rule having passed on to others like drow, ghouls, gugs, and deep gnomes. Yet in remote reaches of this dangerous realm, the ruins of serpentfolk cities still stand. Within, a great many serpentfolk sleep in torpor in secluded vaults, with only a few cells awake to enact their schemes. In addition, a small number of serpentfolk settlements dot Golarion’s surface, most of them in humid, remote jungles, far-flung islands, or caverns close to the surface. It’s rare for such a settlement to number more than a few dozen serpentfolk. They rely primarily on slaves to build their power bases, to defend them, and to perform essentially all the practical functions of their society. This includes providing food, crafting goods, and tending to the serpentfolk’s every need.
Zyss serpentfolk are megalomaniacal geniuses with dreams of returning to their place of dominance, though modern serpentfolk have few means of accomplishing this goal. Many of their plans hinge on resurrecting Ydersius, their decapitated god. His headless body still thrashes about, mindless, in the Darklands, waiting to be reunited with his lost skull. Serpentfolk numbers are so small that reclaiming their dominance seems a distant dream, especially since their reproduction is slow. Though a parent can birth a dozen young at once, the gestation period lasts up to a decade, and the likelihood that even one will be zyss is low. There’s no telling whether a child will be zyss or aapoph, regardless of parentage. A coveted zyss child is just as likely to arise from aapoph parents as from two zyss, and every serpentfolk colony has someone in charge of sorting the young, identifying the earliest signs of intelligence in them.
Though the number of zyss is small in serpentfolk colonies, bringing in more zyss isn’t necessarily desirable. A serpentfolk conclave with just a few zyss is functional, but one with a large number becomes fractious. Cults and societies form, all pursuing their own passions and politics, with scheming and backstabbing running rampant. A powerful priest may be able to bring other zyss to heel, but many zyss question why a priest should be in charge if their god is dead. Zyss thrive on selfish desires for hedonistic pleasure and adulation. They feel no love for others, even their offspring. Thriving on decadence, they crave receiving expensive gifts, gorging themselves on massive meals, and pursing arts such as music, poetry, or sculpture. Even more academic hobbies, like the study of magic or warfare, take an artistic bent, like carefully designing colorful illusions or memorizing epic poems about renowned wars. Each zyss believes themself to have more refined tastes than their peers.
Some serpentfolk might have entirely different innate spells. These alternative spells are typically illusions, enchantments, or divinations like dream message, enthrall, glibness, invisibility, mindlink, mind probe, mind reading, mislead, phantom pain, or zealous conviction. Aapoph serpentfolk lack innate spells.
Ydersius was defeated by an Azlanti heroine named Savith in the era before Earthfall, and now the so-called Headless King's body prowls aimlessly in the Darklands. That the decapitated god's clerics still gain power from worship points to Ydersius's tenacity and continued existence, after a fashion. Those who seek to recover his skull and return it to his body hope that doing so will restore both him and the sekmin civilization to their full power.
The war between the humans of ancient Azlant and the serpentfolk of Sekamina waged on for years. The serpentfolk's defeat threw their society into chaos and undermined their conviction that they would continue to rule simply because they had done so for eons. For millennia, serpentfolk have remained in hiding in their underground fortresses, but many feel it is time to rise again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bone Skipper Swarm.
A large swarm of bone skippers can reduce a human skeleton into dry, brittle fragments in a matter of hours.
Bone skippers eat and breed within the bones of deceased megafauna, such as elephants and teraphants. In areas where their carcasses are rare or quickly disposed of, bone skippers are virtually unknown. Sufficiently large undead creatures, like zombie hulks, might harbor a bone skipper swarm that buzzes around them, defending their gruesome “lairs.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bottlenose Dolphin.
The bottlenose dolphin is the most common and widespread species of dolphin. They are social predators who hunt shallow seas and rivers in large family groups called pods. Sailors are fond of bottlenose dolphins and frequently tell tales of how they save drowning fishers or kill sharks with blows from their powerful snouts.
Dolphins have a somewhat unusual trait—they often come to the aid of other creatures in distress, such as to save a drowning person or to protect someone from the attack of a shark. Not every monster in this book wants to hurt player characters— consider having a dolphin come to an endangered PC's rescue if the situation merits!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Brain Collector.
The grotesque brain collectors (or neh-thalggus, as they call themselves) originate from worlds far beyond the known solar system, and are part of a conglomeration of hostile aliens known collectively as the Dominion of the Black. Whether driven by their own schemes or directives from sinister overlords, brain collectors arrive in living starships to harvest the brains of intelligent creatures. These aberrations draw no nutrition from brains, instead storing them for analysis and as vessels for occult magical energies.
A brain collector’s form evokes that of a tailless scorpion, but the pulsing brain-filled blisters that glisten along its back make them impossible to mistake for merely oversized arachnids. Baleful eyes glare from the joints on their legs, and the unsettling, intrusive whisper-thoughts they telepathically broadcast into the minds of those they seek to feed on can be interpreted as threats or promises alike.
Brain collectors have very little empathy for the denizens of any world they visit, despite the fact that certain cults venerate them, or the Dominion they hail from, as if they were gods. To brain collectors, terrestrial creatures are simply resources for their magical needs and occult powers. They have little interest in worshipping gods or being worshipped themselves, yet they do practice strange forms of religion of their own, in which they consider the primordial forces of deep space as worthy of faith and fear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bralani (Wind Azata).
Bralanis embody the freedom of fair competition, embracing opportunities to test their skills against worthy foes and bring mortals together with the thrill of good-natured sports and contests. Their interest in constructive conflict also extends to higher stakes, such as diplomatic negotiations. In these cases, bralanis ensure that neither side's desires are crushed by the other's and work as mediators when needed. They believe in friendly contests to diffuse tension. When discussions are going well, bralanis step back, allowing the participants to shape their own futures. They delight in sailing through violent storms as wind, basking in the raw energy.
The most powerful of all azatas belong to the cast of demigods known as empyreal lords. These lesser deities maintain many cults across many Material Plane worlds, and count among their kind such diverse demigods as Ashava, a protector of lost spirits and dancer in the moonlight; Black Butterfly, a mysterious agent of Desna and patron of the depths of outer space; and Sinashakti, joyful wanderer and deliverer of wisdom to vagabonds.
While azatas would like to think they are above material wealth, the truth is that most azatas adore finery and displays of beauty or grandeur. They might explain away bejeweled weapons as necessary tools against the forces of evil, or the wild array of jewelry and silks they wear as important diplomatic tools.
The wilds of Elysium play host to a wide array of azatas, the most varied and widespread of the celestials. From the four-eyed mothlike uinuja to the supernaturally verdant and beautiful veranallia, whose lower body is a wondrous garden of wildflowers and plant life, azatas are nothing if not diverse!
While the idyllic realm of Elysium is the home plane of azatas, their overwhelming curiosity and natural wanderlust often lead them to travel far from this plane. On other planes, they can be seeking to right wrongs, looking for entertainment, or merely exploring to see the sights. More than a few azatas, taken by a whimsical urge to spread their sometimes unwelcome jocosity, see it as their duty to tease uptight or humorless mortal creatures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bregdi.
Bregdis hunt warm-blooded prey, lurking in the waters of most major port cities before using their ray-like bodies and hooked claws to hitch onto the underside of boats pulling into port. From beneath the docks and in the channels of settlements, bregdis wait for the careless or unlucky to fall into the water, where they make quick work of their hapless victims.
Although bregdis have little more intelligence than most animals, a particularly opportunistic bregdi might realize that a fishing line often leads to a tasty meal. A bregdi that spots a fishing lure might grab it gently with its claw to imitate a fish caught on the line. Once a fisherman is “hooked” and starts to reel in, the bregdi plays along, slowly approaching the shore while making sluggish struggling motions. Once near land, the bregdi violently tugs on the lure to yank its unsuspecting prey into the water. Bregdis can survive out of water for short periods of time, but only the most desperate bregdis hunt on land.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Brine Shark.
Brine sharks are deadly elementals that roam the endless oceans of the Plane of Water.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Though fire and water classically oppose one another, in the right mixture they can become a dangerous combination. Water elementals heated to a scalding temperature through natural factors such as underwater volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent fire damage with their Strikes, while fire elementals infused with moisture might exude clouds of obscuring or even blinding steam.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Brontosaurus.
Brontosauruses are truly gigantic behemoths, plodding herbivores large enough to be unafraid of all but the most massive predators. Brontosauruses have stout bodies and long, sinuous necks ending in small heads, allowing them to graze from the highest treetops. Their powerful tails are equally as long as their necks and provide counterbalances. Brontosauruses bear their bulk upon four stout legs. Although their feet are capable of crushing entire buildings, these herbivores are generally peaceful and considerate of where they step.
Most brontosauruses are dangerous only when defending themselves or their young, or when panicked enough to stampede. When roused in this way, however, the creatures are truly terrifying: their muscular tails sweep in great arcs and their massive feet crash down heedlessly onto the ground. A brontosaurus is 70 feet long and weighs more than 30 tons.
Brontosauruses belong to a group of dinosaurs known as sauropods, all of which are immense in size. The brachiosaurus is among the tallest of these dinosaurs, and the diplodocus among the longest, but it’s likely that even larger behemoths exist.
While the real world fossil records hold a wealth of inspiration for the reconstruction of dinosaurs in an RPG, you can also look to living creatures for ideas. Giving a dinosaur a poisonous bite or an unusual attack routine like Clobbering Charge ensures that dinosaurs are as interesting in combat as they are in appearance.
As with most animals, dinosaurs can be tamed or domesticated, but the difficulty of this task increases along with the dinosaur’s level. Lizardfolk and orcs are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, workhorses, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In certain cities, dinosaurs are popularly featured as combatants in blood sports and other gladiatorial battles.
As animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear. Dinosaurs can also be harvested for rare and valuable trophies such as teeth, talons, armor plates, and the like.
At first glance, the inclusion of dinosaurs in a fantasy setting might seem strange, but dinosaurs are an excellent creature to use in a game that bridges the gap between familiar real-world animals and legendary monsters. If having dinosaurs mix freely with lions, manticores, and dragons still seems strange to you, consider having them dwell in remote, primeval lands, as suggested in the sidebars on pages 99–100. On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in the wilder regions of the world, particularly on the continent of Garund, though they are common enough that PCs might find some on display in a menagerie in a northern city, in use as guardian creatures, or even kept by druids as loyal animal companions.
Another classic place that dinosaurs are found in fiction are in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal place to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day‑night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam.
In a fantasy setting, magical effects or supernatural influences can enhance dinosaurs by giving them unexpected attacks, modes of movement, or other abilities. You can quickly create a memorable magical beast simply by giving a dinosaur the magical attack of another creature of an equal level, such as a spinosaurus gaining an acidic breath weapon akin to that of an adult black dragon.
A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or a quick online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well. Armor-headed pachycephalosaurs, spike-thumbed iguanodons, duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed spinosauruses, and more await discovery by those who would seek out the mysteries of the lost worlds where the thunder lizards still rule!
Dinosaurs fit well into certain types of settings. They’re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Brood Leech Swarm.
Most smaller species of leeches do not tend to swarm, but brood leeches are prone to gathering in seething, undulant mats of squirming gluttony. When they gather in sufficient numbers to swarm, they eschew the stealth of a lone leech's feeding methods in favor of swift and merciless feeding. In these situations, their mild venom can affect much larger creatures than their usual prey.
The spotted hooktooth leech is often found in areas frequented by trolls, who sometimes wear them as awful decorations, relying on their regeneration to control the bleeding effects. The gigantic elephant leech feeds on immense beasts of the swamplands or jungles, like elephants, froghemoths, and dinosaurs, attacking from unexpected range. But it's the relatively small gutleech that provides the most fuel for nightmares, due to its awful habit of feeding on victims from inside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Brownie.
Brownies make their homes in the trunks of hollow trees, small earthy burrows, and even under porches or within the crawl spaces of farmhouses. Often attired in clothes that appear to be made of plants or leaves, brownies wear belts lined with pouches and tools. Whatever language they choose to speak is often is riddled with odd pronunciations and colloquialisms. Their manner of speaking might call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue, for example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally—certainly they do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There's often no swifter way to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar. Brownies stand barely 2 feet tall and weigh about 20 pounds.
When facing danger, brownies rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to confound and confuse their attackers in order to buy enough time for escape. Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a pacifist nature, harassing creatures only to run them off or punish them for an insult. Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades their “final trick,” reserving their use for the direst of circumstances.
Honest to a fault, brownies take freely but always repay their debt through work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from a farmer's orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their midst usually finds this a beneficial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the resident brownie keeps the home clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators. Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one. Brownies distrust foxes and fear wolves, and they avoid farms with dogs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Brughadatch (Midlife Brughadatch).
The biggest difference between a gahlepod and a grown brughadatch isn’t their humanoid appearance, but the powerful magic they gain as they mature.
Brughadatches of all life stages tend to cohabitate, since their abilities naturally synergize and tip the odds of survival in their favor. A single brughadatch elder—known as a doblagub—leads a clan, while midlife brughadatches serve as scouts, hunters, and laborers. Gahlepods dwell in large, stagnant ponds and bogs around the brughadatches’ holdings, so they are often the first to interact with creatures that carelessly wander into their domain. Adventurers who make it past these bogs often fail to realize the connection between the gahlepods and the amphibious tricksters further on in the swamp until they encounter the doblagub, who is now roused and commands their brethren in battle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bugaboo.
After devouring enough souls, a bogey transforms into the more powerful and sophisticated bugaboo.
While bogeymen stem from bugaboos and bugaboos from bogeys, it is unknown where, exactly, bogeys come from. If superstitious storytellers are to be believed, then bogeys arise from the unfortunate victims kidnapped by bogeymen. According to these tales, victims go missing for months or even years before returning as bogeys to the town they once called home.
Bogeymen and their lesser kin delight in instilling fear in small communities where gossip can quickly amplify their shadowy deeds. In such locales, bogeymen use peoples’ natural tendency to spread misinformation to sow discord and escape notice—for who would rightfully believe that an actual bogeyman is behind the latest murder?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bugbear Thug.
The more common bugbear thug specializes in the art of lurking in the shadows.
Bugbears live in small gangs that often prowl together, working as a group to sow torment. They keep their lairs in hard-to-find places deep in the forest or hills.
Though bugbears don't have much concern for treasure, they're prone to keeping gruesome trophies. Some might keep a leather cord strung with ears from their victims, while others collect severed fingers or noses. Bits of valuable jewelry can sometimes remain on these grisly prizes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bugbear Tormentor.
The bugbear tormentor seeks to torture their prey as much through psychological intimidation as through physical harm. The longer a bugbear tormentor can keep their victim alive and terrified, the better they feel.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Bugul Noz.
This gangly fey humanoid wanders the overgrown paths of dark, misty forests, voluntarily isolating themself in an attempt to protect others from their hideous form. A bugul noz’s appearance is not merely unsightly—to view the being’s form is said to tempt death, and backwoods villagers tell tales of wanderers found struck dead after merely glancing at the creature. As they jaunt through the forest, the bugul noz sings an eerie tune to alert others to their presence and deter these creatures from looking upon them. The bugul noz does not, after all, want to harm anyone; they are inherently kind, if unpredictable, and if they accidentally kill a creature out of panic or confusion, they grieve. A bugul noz who roams the same road long enough compiles a long list of such accidental victims, and they might carry the corpses off to a single mass grave deep in the forest. When not wandering, the bugul noz watches over this grave to ensure that the spirits of their victims are never lonely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bulette.
Bulettes are fearsome predators that roam just beneath the surface of desolate wilderness areas. When they burrow through the ground, only the fin of their thickly armored backs protrudes above—at least until they are ready to leap out and strike their prey. Their appearance, appetite, and iconic dorsal fin have earned the nickname “landshark.”
A typical bulette claims a territory of approximately 500 square miles. When it finds an area rich in food, such as a farming village, it adds that area to its regular patrol route. Over the course of a few months, it can wipe entire settlements off the map. Bulettes are fiercely competitive creatures that battle relentlessly with other predators in their territory. They actively avoid contact or conflict with other members of their kind unless seeking a mate. Bulette pairs share territory and mate for life—a mated pair of bulettes being the only known exception to the creature’s penchant for solitude. They rear their young for a short period of time. The mated pair instruct the young bulette how to hunt, teaching their spawn which creatures are easiest to kill and which creatures to avoid. The mated pair drive off their young after its first successful hunt.
The first bulettes were magically created guardians, intended to serve as frightening pets for a power-hungry and sadistic wizard. The technique for their creation, as well as their original purpose, has since been lost to history, and multiple conflicting accounts of ancient texts exist with dozens of wizards claiming to have been the first inventor of the notorious beast. Some sages postulate that the original inventor may have been an elf—a theory born out of little more than the curious fact that bulettes, for all their ravenous nature, seem to find elf flesh unpalatable. Unfortunately for elves who stumble into a bulette’s path, bulettes are no less likely to kill them than any other intruder, simply leaving the bodies unconsumed where they fall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bunyip.
Bunyips are dangerous aquatic predators that resemble a cross between a shark and a seal. Found in freshwater inlets or saltwater coves worldwide, bunyips hunt where prey is plentiful, often to the consternation of coastal residents and fisherfolk.
Despite their outlandish appearance and tendency to defend their territory with loud, bellowing roars that echo for great distances, bunyips are very rarely sighted by humanoids, leaving many to question their existence. For hundreds of years, bunyips were widely regarded as nothing more than folk tales, and even now that their existence as a species has been proven, the existence of any particular bunyip in a local area is often met with heavy skepticism. While their limited shapechanging abilities are no doubt a significant part of the reason for this air of mystery, another major factor is that the aquatic creatures rarely hunt humanoids, preferring to eat smaller animals. Most bunyips avoid human contact, except when one wanders too close to their den or favorite hunting spot, at which point the territorial bunyip attacks with swift and terrible ferocity. Many scholars agree that a large number of unexplained disappearances near coastal areas are the result of unreported bunyip aggression.
In some ports, bunyips have learned that delicious prizes can be had from the chum and garbage discarded by fishing boats and merchant vessels. They lurk close to the shore and carefully choose their victims, plucking them off docks and small boats. These bunyips are particularly careful to keep their true forms hidden, but this does little to dull rumors of monster-infested waters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Bythos.
The bythos is a guardian of space and time, and at all times seeks out those who misuse planar and temporal magic. A bythos is a roughly humanoid creature with four arms and a body made of swirling clouds and mist. Despite its appearance, its body feels like dry stone. A bythos seeks out paradoxes caused by irresponsible planar or dimensional travelers and repairs breaches where the barriers between planes have become thin or damaged. If the mortals responsible remain in the area and cannot be convinced to cease their activities, the bythos has no qualms about removing them. Using its ability to manipulate time, a bythos might cause an opponent to quickly die of old age as time speeds up around them, or cause a target to disappear from time and space.
As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons’ war against imbalance—particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos.
Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the “Convergence.” At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons — but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How—or if—this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves.
Whether the aeons serve an actual divinity, a philosophical concept, or merely a “supreme oneness” is a topic hotly debated by planar scholars. The aeons themselves are silent, referring to this being or concept as the Monad, a “condition of all.” Regardless of what the Monad actually is, there certainly exists another category of powerful aeons—the primal inevitables, each a unique demigod with its own powers and goals. Relatively few primal inevitables remain today, for nearly three-quarters of their irreplaceable kind have fallen in the endless battle with the inexorable forces of entropy.
Aeons are among the least understood of the Great Beyond’s immortal creatures, and they have a wide range of powers and abilities. Far more aeons exist than those presented here, including guardians of time like the four-armed bythos and the weirdly symmetrical theletos, which moderates the duality between freedom and fate.
To mortals, aeons sometimes seem to combine elements that are fundamentally incompatible, whether it's an aeon combining opposing concepts, or axiomites and inevitables mixing the organic with the mathematical or mechanical. Aeons see no paradox in this, but rather claim it is an expression of the underlying unity of all things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cacodaemon (Harvester Daemon).
These embodiments of demented violence and spite are spawned from eddies of angry and warped souls amid Abaddon’s mists. Cacodaemons constantly hunger for mortal souls and yearn to create suffering. As gnashing spheres of teeth, fins, and spines, they are the weakest of daemonkind, an amalgam of various petty forms of death without the strength that comes from focusing on a single cause of demise.
While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals’ fear.
While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane of pure evil for only the most corrupt souls. If Hell is a realm of torture and systematic depravity, Abaddon is its twisted cousin—a place where one can find only misery and despair in ample quantities, with neither the strictures of Hell nor the chaotic freedom of the Abyss. For evildoers who seek simply to inflict their wickedness on others, Abaddon is a rich hunting ground where one can revel in turpitude, though visitors be forewarned: the competition is fierce.
The four Horsemen are the most powerful of the daemonic demigods, but they are only four of many. Far more daemonic harbingers dwell on Abaddon, each a unique and powerful demigod in their own right that enjoys sweeping influence among daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector (ruler of the slave city of Awaiting Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian (consort to the Horseman of Famine), and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame (patron to arsonists and agent of the Horseman of War) are but three of the dozens of harbingers who rule realms in Abaddon.
Each of the four Horsemen is served by a specific category of servitor daemons known as deacons. Leukodaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Pestilence. Meladaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Famine, while thanadaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Death. Purrodaemons are currently the most powerful of the deacons, and serve the Horseman of War—yet over time, which category of deacon is the most powerful can wax and wane.
Numerous powerful and unique daemon demigods, known collectively as harbingers, rule over swaths of Abaddon. Above these demigods, though, are entities of even greater power—the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. As the eons go on, the names and identities of specific horsemen change. Currently, they consist of Apollyon (Horseman of Pestilence), Charon (Horseman of Death), Szuriel (Horseman of War), and Trelmarixian (Horseman of Famine). Of these, only Charon has never fallen to an upstart. Some hold that a “Fifth Horseman” once ruled over the other four, while others maintain that the eternally eclipsed sun in the skies above Abaddon is all that remains of this long-dead god.
As many daemons exist as there are awful ways to die. The bloody sangudaemon personifies death by blood loss, while the skeletal thanadaemon represents death from old age. The most powerful daemons are the olethrodaemons, who represent the massive deaths caused by apocalypses and the end of entire worlds.
Daemons often carry soul gems either as trophies or for powering an ability. Cacodaemons are the most common source for soul gems, but they can also be created by spells like bind soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem to power an ability, the trapped soul is released into the afterlife and can be resurrected normally.
Soul gems are traded in illicit markets, a tradition celestials and psychopomps alike find vile. Soul gems' value varies, but is generally worth an amount relative to the level of a gem's captive soul.
Daemons embody a fundamental paradox—while they are incarnations of death and seek to devour all that lives, they are themselves living creatures. Some speak of a glorious end time after which reality will finally be free of the contagion that is life itself. Most daemons give no thought to this paradox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cairn Linnorm.
Cairn linnorms are disturbing, even by linnorm standards. They make their homes in necropolises, burial grounds, and the sites of immense and gory battles. Some point out that cairn linnorms feast on shambling undead and thus provide a service to the living, but these beasts are not choosy and will happily consume any creature, whether or not it draws breath.
Some tales state that cairn linnorms will not—or cannot—enter a tomb without the permission of a descendant of the deceased (or the permission of the deceased itself, in the instance that it has risen from the dead). Likewise, once a cairn linnorm has entered a tomb, it won't leave until it has secured permission to do so. Whether such legends are true or not is anyone's guess; nevertheless, reports of a cairn linnorm in the vicinity are harrowing enough to dissuade even the most foolhardy grave robber from peeking into too many crypts or mausoleums.
The death curses of the linnorms are often the subjects of tragic sagas, and those who would think themselves vanquishing heroes for slaying a linnorm often meet their dooms soon thereafter, succumbing to these curses well after the death of the linnorm responsible for bestowing it.
Linnorms have a deep connection to the First World, the primordial home of the fey. While linnorms typically won't think twice before devouring a gnome or other fey, they do have an unusual respect for wielders of powerful primal magic. The only way to cow a linnorm, according to common wisdom, is to remind it that there are forces of nature even stronger than itself.
In the storied Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the slaying of a linnorm is traditionally required for those who would claim a nation’s crown. Recently, though, the Linnorm King White Estrid claimed her crown not by slaying a linnorm but by beating it into submission, gaining a powerful and dangerous ally to help secure her rule.
Creatures as powerful as linnorms tend to spawn stories of their own, accurate or not. Critical failure on a check to Recall Knowledge on linnorms might suggest that you can avoid a linnorm's death curse by closing your eyes as you deliver the fatal blow, or that rubbing poison oak on yourself can ward off a linnorm's attention.
As with true dragons, linnorms tend to amass immense piles of treasure in their lairs. These hoards consist of the weapons, gear, and belongings of would-be vanquishers more often than minted coins or works of art.
Almost all linnorms lead solitary lives; they are too reprehensible for even their own kind to tolerate for any length of time. Most species do not even meet to reproduce; rather, female linnorms usually deposit a solitary egg in a remote location, which a wandering male linnorm then fertilizes and places in a nook suitable for incubation. Newborn linnorms range in size from that of adult crocodiles to full-grown bulls, and their growth is rapid. Even a juvenile linnorm is strong enough to wreak havoc on a small settlement— though most don't dare to commit such audacious pillaging, for fear of evoking the anger of another, larger linnorm in the area.
Linnorms exist in a variety of forms beyond the four detailed here. The gaunt cairn linnorm, the spiny taiga linnorm, and the aquatic fjord linnorm each terrorize their own specific regions of the Material Plane.
While the linnorms presented here and in the first Bestiary constitute the majority of these creatures, others exist, particularly in the remote regions of the First World. It may be that these rare linnorms simply find the Material Plane too constraining for their might!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cairn Wight.
Jealous guardians of tombs, barrows, and sepulchers, cairn wights usually spawn from necromantic rituals. For those mortals who cannot abide the thought of separation from their earthly possessions, the undead existence offered by transformation into a cairn wight can be tempting. Perhaps as frequently, particularly avaricious and wealthy royalty or merchants seek out victims to transform into cairn wights to guard their precious wealth for all time.
Only in the rarest instances is the greed of a mortal strong enough to spontaneously transform them into a cairn wight without a dark ritual or the intercession of a powerful divine being. On those occasions, however, the resultant wight exhibits unmatched viciousness and likely owns rare treasure indeed.
As guardians of material possessions, cairn wights are supernaturally bound to the armaments they wore during the ritual used to create them. They can spread their necromantic powers into the weapons they wield. A slash from a cairn wight's sword channels life from the victim into the wight.
As many types of wights exist as types of people from which they might be created. Hulking brutes, skittering sneaks, and cunning tinkers all make for different wights with different niches to fill. Environment, too, plays a part in determining a wight's special abilities and defenses. Frost wights, for instances, can be found in the parts of the world where exposure is a common end. Regardless, wights typically haunt burial grounds, catacombs, or other places of the dead. But their hunger is targeted toward the living—those individuals who remind them of the shackles of mortality and whom they feel compelled to “free” to the state of undeath.
A single wight can wreak a lot of havoc if it is compelled to rise from its tomb. Because creatures slain by wights become wights as well, all it takes is a single wight and a handful of unlucky graveyard visitors to create a veritable horde of these undead. Thus, canny priests and adventurers know that the best solution to a wight problem is swift and total eradication. Care must be taken, though, to destroy wight spawn before attempting to destroy the parent wight, for spawn without a master gain the ability to create spawn of their own.
Durable and sustained as they are by negative energy, wights can last in harsh environments without decaying the way some lesser undead do. They might dwell in high mountain passes, sealed passageways, or submerged in bogs or lakes for decades or even centuries before the passage of an unsuspecting traveler rouses them from their rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Calathgar.
Calathgars are mysterious predatory plants that grow in the depths of the densest frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from snow-cloaked trees. A calathgar's blue flowers grow from 3 to 5 feet across (with specimens as wide as 10 feet reported), while the plant itself stands just under 4 feet in height and weighs up to 50 pounds when heavy with seeds.
Calathgars' psyches are alien to most sapient creatures. They have little interest in emotion, culture, or ambition, yet they have nearly flawless memories and can share experiences with other calathgars by scent (perceptible to other creatures as a vinegary odor that may reveal their presence) as easily as humanoids can pass on information by speech. While calathgars themselves can't speak, they can typically be reasoned with—though like most protective parents, an incensed calathgar defending its young is rarely in a mood to listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Caligni Creeper.
The most widespread of the caligni are the mischievous caligni creepers.
Many calignis hide shiny baubles and trinkets beneath their dark rags, keeping them out of sight of their greedy kin. They also keep several doses of black smear poison on hand to incapacitate foes.
The calignis are descendants of humans who, millennia ago, fled underground to escape a devastating cataclysm and begged malevolent, shadowy demigods known only as the Forsaken for salvation. The Forsaken warped the refugees into tough survivors, but at a price: every caligni that dies combusts in a burst of energy that provides a scrap of soul energy to the Forsaken. The greatest irony of the caligni's bargain is that the Forsaken themselves mysteriously vanished long ago and no longer answer pleas or prayers. Today, caligni still burst into light upon death, but their soul energy no longer feeds a mysterious pantheon of shadowy divinities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Caligni Dancer.
Caligni dancers serve as intermediaries between caligni clans.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Caligni Slayer.
Caligni slayers possess greater occult talents than others of their kind. In most other calignis, the power bartered from the long-lost demigods known as the Forsaken merely burns within. But in caligni slayers, this power is a deep and terrible hunger. Slayers embrace their evil impulses as a result, and they seek to feed on others with their soul harvest ability to keep this supernatural hunger sated. Slayers denied the opportunity to feed descend into paranoia and, eventually, murderous rage.
Delayed feeding improves but never fully restores their composure and patience. Perhaps the greatest manifestation of a slayer's hunger appears at the moment of their death. Upon its last breath, a slayer collapses into itself in a violent, lightless implosion, rather than the blinding eruption of other calignis' deaths, consuming the body itself in a final attempt at satiation.
Slayers view themselves as the cleverest and most gifted of the calignis. They seethe with ill-concealed envy at the position of power caligni stalkers occupy, ever scheming to displace them and claim that power for their own. For their part, stalkers tolerate these machinations as an acceptable price for the talents slayers contribute to an enclave. If necessary, any slayer who grows too ambitious can become a brave sacrifice in battle, for the good of the enclave. In physical stature, slayers fall between the willowy caligni dancers and the diminutive creepers. Stalkers tower above most slayers—yet another source of slayers' envy and resentment.
Many calignis hide shiny baubles and trinkets beneath their dark rags, keeping them out of sight of their greedy kin. They also keep several doses of black smear poison on hand to incapacitate foes.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Calikang.
The calikangs are giant blue-skinned, six-armed guardians of ancient tombs and treasuries. Their unique physiologies enable them to absorb and manipulate electrical magic, as well as other energies. A calikang can live for 200 years—though it may further extend its life via suspended animation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Carbuncle.
Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow than that of the lowly carbuncle. At first glance, carbuncles appear to be little more than ungainly reptiles. What sets them apart is their strange magical abilities and the gemstone-like horn protruding from between their goggling eyes. Although rumors suggest various uses for carbuncle horns, ranging from miracle cure-alls to potent magical components, the truth is much more mundane: a carbuncle's horn is merely a highly reflective growth, not unlike a fingernail.
“Carbuncles are real! I almost caught one, but even though it could barely walk, its magic allowed it to escape my clutches.”
“Their mind control powers could make them useful familiars, but if you ever catch one, it dies of fright.”
“My advice is to stay away from these pests. They drink your hopes and aspirations through their horns, leaving you empty except for bad luck and bellyaches.”
“Planning a carbuncle hunt? You'd better leave your self-respect at home, and be ready to emerge with fewer friends than you had at the start!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Carnivorous Blob.
Carnivorous blobs are the ravenous spawn of shattered worlds far beyond the stars, born across the galaxy in inert form until they fall like meteorites onto unsuspecting worlds. These massive beings can lie dormant for years in desolate caverns or barren wastelands. When a carnivorous blob perceives living creatures nearby, it lurches to gelatinous life, seeking out and consuming every creature it can catch until it is destroyed or until it has been unable to locate food for 24 hours, at which point it returns to hibernation. Often, keeping food away from a carnivorous blob is the safest way to defeat it. The blob's ability to split into smaller oozes that might stay hidden after a fight means it can be hard to fully eradicate these mindless predators.
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms are usually found near each other, as the two oozes are part of the same life cycle. When a giant amoeba grows large enough, it can spontaneously split apart into two separate amoeba swarms, and when an amoeba swarm feeds enough, its individual components can fuse together into a single creature.
Many oozes have acidic attacks that can quickly degrade flesh, wood, and even stronger materials. Some believe that oozes are the result of alchemical or magical experimentation run amok, while others postulate that they simply emerged from the natural processes of evolution.
Many varieties of these nearly mindless predators exist in the world. Some are mere variants, with different colored puddings, jellies, and oozes with little to differentiate them from those presented here other than their habitat. Others are more specialized, or even dangerously intelligent. The shoggoth is one such example, but another variety of deadly and powerful ooze is the thankfully rare blight, a creature composed of protoplasm and eyes that curses entire regions with its presence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Carnivorous Crystal.
Carnivorous crystals are strange ooze creatures native to the Plane of Earth. Unlike most oozes, their bodies are not homogeneously fluid; rather, interspersed within their glassy, viscous resin are thousands of sharp mineral formations that nevertheless possess some of the same flexibility and mobility as the rest of the creature’s gooey body.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Carrion Golem.
Carrion golems are foul-smelling and fly-swarmed amalgams of putrefied parts stitched together from many different creatures. Unlike most golems, carrion golems only rarely are given a humanoid form, instead appearing more twisted and bestial in frame. As a result, some students of golem crafting claim that the carrion golem isn't a “true golem,” but regardless of those claims these foul constructs certainly share other golem-like traits, including their significant immunities. What is true is that most who craft carrion golems don't do so out of true interest in the technique of golem crafting, but for the golem's ability to spread disease. The crafters of carrion golems send their mindless minions to cause immediate destruction and leave wakes of illness and death behind them.
Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called “golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.
Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell can affect the golem.
Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.
Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.
Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cassisian (Archive Angel).
The weakest of angels, cassisians usually serve as lackey messengers for more powerful angels or as spiritual guides for mortals. Despite their limited intellect, cassisians have a knack for precise recollection, particularly with scripture. Most cassisians are formed from the souls of trustworthy mortals, but some arise from fragments of greater angels destroyed in service to the celestial realms.
The most powerful angels belong to a category of demigods known as the empyreal lords—a title shared with other powerful good-aligned demigods among the host of archons, azatas, and other inhabitants of the celestial planes. The most powerful and most well-known of the angelic empyreal lords is Sarenrae.
Angels normally live on Nirvana or other celestial planes, but their missions can bring them to the Material Plane. Spellcasters can conjure them for aid or advice in times of need, and they can even be found, if rarely, crusading against fiends in Hell, the Abyss, or anywhere in between.
Many angels wear exquisite armor or wield beautiful and often magical weapons. While they are not hampered by mortal sins like greed or pride (save for the very rare and tragic exception), they do enjoy the beauty of fine clothing, exquisite jewelry, and works of art.
The most powerful angels are known as the solars, but numerous others can be found in Nirvana working their own missions or goals. Angels generally appear as beautiful, often somewhat androgynous humanoids, and the most powerful often possess two or even four sets of feathered wings.
Three types of devas exist among the angelic host, all of which serve as angelic “field agents.” Of the types of angels, devas are the ones most likely to be encountered dwelling somewhere other than Nirvana, as these angels focus their work on cultivating and protecting goodness in mortal souls, be they living or dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Catfolk Pouncer.
Catfolk pouncers travel the world in search of new experiences.
Ever eager to explore and learn, catfolk have spread to other parts of the world from their native nations in the southern tropics, yet never in large groups. A lone catfolk can be found anywhere in the world, but it’s rare to find a settlement beyond their traditional national borders. This is due to their innate wanderlust and insatiable wonder. As many a catfolk might say, “I’ve lived with my people my whole life, but you? You’re new and different! There’s so much to learn from you!”
Longstanding amurrun legends claim the catfolk were first created as guardians and were then charged with protecting the world from those sinister forces that exist at its fringes. Often, this charge manifests as a longstanding opposition to cultists of demon lords, archdevils, and other fiendish demigods. Many catfolk worship the spirits of creation, using serendipitous rituals to attract good fortune and banish ill luck in the spirits’ name, while others venerate their own small pantheon of divinities. Those who travel often find comfort in the worship of Desna, whose teachings closely match their own predilections.
Catfolk adapt well to adventuring roles, and can be quite diverse in their areas of study and specialization. Those who follow the traditions of rangers and rogues are perhaps the most commonly encountered, but not overwhelmingly so. Their natural curiosity leads some catfolk to take up mystical arts, training as wizards or following a divine path to become clerics.
Catfolk claim to hail from a faroff nation called Murraseth in southern Garund. It is a nation rumored to hold a dark secret at its center, the details of which its discreet inhabitants do not willingly divulge to outsiders. Indeed, few adventurers from the Inner Sea region have managed to gain entrance to Murraseth, let alone discover any of its mysteries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Catoblepas.
The catoblepas is an aggressive beast at the best of times. Though it prefers swamps, the catoblepas has been know to forage in plains and forests for short periods, leaving behind hunting grounds tainted by its foul breath and noxious waste that other predators and prey alike avoid for days or even weeks thereafter. The catoblepas bullies those creatures it believes are a match for it, and eats everything weaker.
A catoblepas is 15 feet long and weighs 2,200 pounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Catrina.
Not all spirits who enter the Boneyard realize they have died. Catrinas meet these souls, helping to convince them of the finality of their fate to ease a spirit's passing. Catrinas are more likely to intervene when a mortal can't accept their death. They perform their task to keep the afterlife calm, rather than out of true compassion for a mortal's grief. Catrinas only rarely visit the Material Plane, typically to help an extremely important mortal pass on.
Catrinas resemble skeletons dressed in bright flowers and colorful dresses, giving them a simultaneously festive and macabre appearance. Though most catrinas present as feminine, masculine catrinas still dress in bright colors and carry garlands of flowers.
Nosois and morrignas are far from the only of their kind. Many others, like the skeletal vanths or the draconic yamarajes, also aid in the stewardship of the dead.
Psychopomps rarely oppose celestials or fiends. In fact, they frequently host such creatures in the Boneyard, particularly in the sprawling psychopomp courts where these outsiders petition for one soul or another to be remanded to their jurisdiction. Complicated cases are judged by yamarajes, while the thorniest or most politically delicate are handed by Pharasma herself.
Psychopomps' greatest enemies are creatures that devour or steal souls, such as astradaemons and night hags. Their other opponents include necromancers, proteans, and those who have unnaturally extended their lifespan, such as liches.
Some psychopomps view their task of sorting souls as ultimately hollow and meaningless, since the multiverse itself must one day end. Eons ago, these rebels shirked their duties and fled to the empty corners of the planes, becoming a new type of evil creature called a sahkil. Sahkils feed on mortal fears, particularly fears of death, and enjoy tormenting those who must die. Psychopomps generally leave these malcontents alone, except when sahkils interfere with the proper flow of souls.
The most powerful of the psychopomps are unique demigods known collectively as “ushers,” each of whom has its own cult. These psychopomp divinities include Atropos, the Last Sister; Barzahk, the Passage; Ceyanan, the Shepherd; Dammar, the Denied; Imot, the Symbol of Doom; Mother Vulture, the Flesheater; Mrtyu, Death's Consort; Narakas, the Cleansing Sentence; the Pale Horse; Phlegyas, Consoler of Atheists; Saloc, Minder of Immortals; Teshallas, the Primordial Poison; and Vale, the Court of the Ancestors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cat Sith.
Cat siths can easily pass for common black house cats, noteworthy only for the white spots on their chests and their unusually bristly personalities. In actuality, they are cunning fey, fully capable of speech, trickery, and even walking upright on their hind legs and using their forepaws almost as skillfully as hands. Cat siths live around highland towns and cities, regularly venturing unnoticed into nearby communities by posing as domesticated felines or using magic to take humanoid form. While some cat siths gather information and undertake tasks for more powerful fey creatures, others serve only their own mysterious agendas.
Cat siths are harbingers of misfortune and find amusement in the unluckiness that follows in their wake. Though they are rarely malicious, they are fascinated by death in all its forms, and may go so far as to steal the souls of the dying for some inscrutable purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cauthooj.
These large, flightless birds are deceptively agile, considering their long bodies and awkward, hopping gait. Solitary predators, they use their hypnotic warbling song to drive prey into a wild frenzy, manipulating them into attacking one another so that the cauthooj can then feast on the remains.
Known to some scholars as the puppet master bird, and to others as the shrill shrike, cauthoojs are widely reviled by most intelligent humanoids, in part because the birds seem to prefer humanoids to other prey. Cauthooj sightings typically lead to the creation of hunting parties to track the creature down before it can kill again, with would-be hunters typically stuffing their ears full of wax in an effort to avoid being affected by its cry. Those who have survived the creature’s song report that the experience is uniquely unnerving, and almost all accounts agree that there is no other sound as terrible.
While one might assume the cauthooj is a dumb animal, these creatures are in fact quite a bit smarter than they look. Cauthoojs stalk the perimeter of remote settlements in hopes of finding a lone traveler they can feast upon. These patient creatures will wait in ambush as long as they must to sate their hunger. They can even understand a few rudimentary words in Sylvan, although they are incapable of clearly speaking themselves. This doesn’t stop the cauthooj from attempting to mimic the sounds it hears, but when it does so, its eerie primal nature enhances the attempt, leading to the bird’s signature ability to manipulate minds and encourage conflict, a trait the cauthooj is just barely smart enough to understand—and enjoy.
Like magpies, cauthoojs are attracted to shiny baubles, and they often pick up choice treasures from their victims, depositing these trinkets in large piles in their lairs. Not all that glitters is gold, however, and adventurers will find as many colorful bits of string, broken mirror shards, and pieces of costume jewelry as they find coins, magic weapons, and other valuable treasures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cave Bear.
Larger, stronger, and far more aggressive than its smaller cousins, the cave bear is a behemoth that avoids civilized lands, preferring to dwell in remote places. As its name might suggest, the cave bear makes its den in natural caves, and like the grizzly bear, a cave bear is fiercely territorial. Unlike a grizzly bear, however, a cave bear is short tempered and will make sure its foe is dead before moving on, usually feasting on its prey’s soft flesh once it has been incapacitated. Cave bears are often regarded as powerful guardian spirits by remote-dwelling people, while they are utilized as beasts of war by orcs or even giants—stone giants in particular have an affinity for keeping trained cave bears as pets or guardians for their homes.
A bear den can contain valuable treasures, such as the remains of less fortunate adventurers who stumbled into a hungry bear’s path. Bear furs themselves are valued as rugs, while their claws and fangs make for impressive jewelry or adornments for armor. Bear hide is an excellent resource for hide armor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cave Fisher.
Cave fishers lurk in dark corners near the ceilings of caves and underground structures, lying in wait for prey to approach. When it does, the cave fisher excretes thin, tough, and very sticky filaments at its prey with lightning speed to capture it.
A cave fisher eats just about any live prey smaller than itself, though anything smaller than a rat isn't much of a meal for it. When a cave fisher captures such a creature, it often leaves the hapless animal entangled, using it as bait to attract larger creatures. Because the adhesive on its filament doesn't last long, the fisher frequently needs to eat one filament and excrete a new one. The filaments are translucent and can be hard to see when they're still and in darkness.
Cave fishers hatch with the ability to excrete filaments, but they molt many times before reaching their adult size of about 7 feet long and 400 pounds. They often leave shed shells in conspicuous locations as decoys.
A severed filament can be harvested for use as rope. The adhesive dries after about 10 minutes. A harvested filament gland can't produce new filaments, but it can be used as 25 gp worth of raw materials for creating potent adhesives, such as sovereign glue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cavern Troll.
Insatiable scavengers stalking the eternal gloom of the Darklands, cavern trolls consume all in their path—even rocks and minerals when more nourishing sustenance is scarce. These rocky goliaths can tunnel through stone with their iron-sharp claws.
Cavern trolls rarely venture to the surface world, for they have a debilitating vulnerability to sunlight that petrifies them on sustained contact. Unlike common trolls, cavern trolls can regenerate wounds dealt by fire. The crystalline nature of their skin, however, permits sonic attacks to neutralize their signature regeneration.
As cavern trolls age, their flinty skin becomes studded with small crystals and stones of various composition. Paragons of their kind have toothy maws replete with large, crystalline fangs. A typical cavern troll stands 14 feet in height and weighs about 2,000 pounds.Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager’s stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls’ capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand—a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies.
The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures’ power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll’s vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though—even the smallest scrap of a troll’s flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster’s entire body until nothing remains.
Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such “troll kings” possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well—mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous— but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood.
Particularly devout trolls, called augurs, claim to possess the so‑called “gift of sight,” which they believe was granted them by the demon lord Urxehl. Augurs practice a disturbing method of future‑telling, in which a troll slashes open its own abdomen and pulls out its entrails to interpret the prophecies in its quivering innards. Other cultists prod and agitate their gutted diviner to keep it conscious throughout the gruesome ordeal.
The blood of trolls is a valuable and difficult-to-procure substance of intense interest to alchemists, witches, and doctors the world over. Though initially it is of little interest other than its unnaturally vibrant hue, when processed correctly its applications are numerous. Experiments have produced oils that restore lost limbs, potions that grant the imbiber supernatural strength, and even smoke bombs that cause anyone caught in the haze to fly into an unstoppable rage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cave Scorpion.
Cave scorpions prefer to reside in underground lairs. Most have lost nearly all of their pigmentation, making them appear ghostly when they lurk at the edge of the light. While they prefer to eat large insects, cave scorpions can and will attack humanoids. Some Darklands societies have developed techniques to herd or lure scorpions into pest-infested tunnels and warrens at the edge of their settlements, where the scorpions thrive in a dual role of exterminators and guardians.
While scorpions are often symbols of death or evil, their venom can be extracted and used for a wide variety of medical applications. A character can milk an incapacitated giant scorpion to extract raw scorpion venom, which can be used as raw materials to craft giant scorpion venom or lesser antiplague. To determine the value of ingredients you gain each day and the DC of the appropriate Medicine or Lore check, use the level 3 task entry in Table 4–2: Income Earned.
Those rescued from death in the burning sands often recount the same dying vision: a strange, silver-eyed woman whose scarlet silk tents stand on the back of a colossal black scorpion, riding out of a shattered city and leading an army of the dead across a sea of glass toward the world of the living. Millennium-old paintings on the walls of rediscovered tombs depict a similar desert rider. The identity of this red-robed woman is unknown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Centaur.
Centaurs are legendary hunters and trackers who resemble heavily muscled humans with the bodies of powerful horses from the waist down. They are typically reclusive but haughty, quick to assume that their handsome physiques and long history of cultural traditions make them superior to any two-legged folk they encounter. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and humanoid settlers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take kindly to outsiders who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which have been ruled by centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their finely honed hunting skills to inflict deadly wounds.
Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an earthquake. Despite their insular nature, some centaurs form close alliances with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such allies are often surprised to learn the depths of centaurs’ honor, pragmatism, and wilderness lore. Rarely, a centaur leaves its tribe to travel the wider world. Such lone centaur wanderers more easily integrate into humanoid societies, but other centaurs are quick to assume that some dishonor led to their exile and thus give such vagabonds a wide berth.
Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual size and coloration. Their upper bodies are fairly similar within a tribe and even region, but their lower bodies—like those of horses—can vary widely from parent to child. Most centaurs are at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 2,000 pounds.
Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members, usually led by an old, powerful seer or battle-hardened warrior who has carried out many noble deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the tribe to roam far from civilization to preserve the ways of its ancestors, while an aggressive warrior might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid settlements and even rival centaur groups.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Centipede Swarm.
Swarms of centipedes are dangerous indeed, ravenous carpets of skittering hunger capable of devouring a traveler whole in a matter of minutes. Some alchemists submerge whole centipedes taken from swarms in their elixirs and some mutagens, claiming such infusions increase potency, though other say this is nothing more than quackish claptrap. Kobolds and mitflits are both known to incorporate swarms of centipedes into cunning traps, from simple pits filled with vermin or more complex affairs involving chutes that dump the vermin onto the heads of unwary intruders.
Centipedes take nearly countless forms amid nearly every climate, with specific traits and abilities varying wildly between species. Tangled forests, arid deserts, foul sewers, deep caverns, and abandoned buildings are all common haunts for centipedes, from oversized specimens capable of taking down significant prey alone to carpets of frenzied vermin gathered into a dangerous swarm. Larger and more specialized centipedes than the two presented here exist, such as the sleek giant whiptail centipede or the immense titan centipede.
All centipedes prefer to eat carrion, gathering in numbers around large corpses or battlefields and jealously guarding their troves of flesh from any who would disturb them. Monstrous centipedes are also aggressive hunters and are particularly fond of devouring horses and similar creatures, often snatching a mount right out from under its rider. They are unusually stealthy for creatures of their size, making their swift strikes all the more frightening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ceustodaemon (Guardian Daemon).
Ceustodaemons are formed from the souls of vile mortals, particularly those who took efforts to hasten their own death, their willingness shaping them into daemonic servants. Their otherworldly senses make them useful for protecting vaults and similar locations on the Material Plane. Ceustodaemons are created to serve, but always seek ways to subvert their bindings, so they can rend their mortal summoners’ flesh. The worst type of conjurer calls upon ceustodaemons merely to set them free into the world in hopes of currying favor with the powers of Abaddon.
While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals’ fear.
While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane of pure evil for only the most corrupt souls. If Hell is a realm of torture and systematic depravity, Abaddon is its twisted cousin—a place where one can find only misery and despair in ample quantities, with neither the strictures of Hell nor the chaotic freedom of the Abyss. For evildoers who seek simply to inflict their wickedness on others, Abaddon is a rich hunting ground where one can revel in turpitude, though visitors be forewarned: the competition is fierce.
The four Horsemen are the most powerful of the daemonic demigods, but they are only four of many. Far more daemonic harbingers dwell on Abaddon, each a unique and powerful demigod in their own right that enjoys sweeping influence among daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector (ruler of the slave city of Awaiting Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian (consort to the Horseman of Famine), and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame (patron to arsonists and agent of the Horseman of War) are but three of the dozens of harbingers who rule realms in Abaddon.
Each of the four Horsemen is served by a specific category of servitor daemons known as deacons. Leukodaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Pestilence. Meladaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Famine, while thanadaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Death. Purrodaemons are currently the most powerful of the deacons, and serve the Horseman of War—yet over time, which category of deacon is the most powerful can wax and wane.
Numerous powerful and unique daemon demigods, known collectively as harbingers, rule over swaths of Abaddon. Above these demigods, though, are entities of even greater power—the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. As the eons go on, the names and identities of specific horsemen change. Currently, they consist of Apollyon (Horseman of Pestilence), Charon (Horseman of Death), Szuriel (Horseman of War), and Trelmarixian (Horseman of Famine). Of these, only Charon has never fallen to an upstart. Some hold that a “Fifth Horseman” once ruled over the other four, while others maintain that the eternally eclipsed sun in the skies above Abaddon is all that remains of this long-dead god.
As many daemons exist as there are awful ways to die. The bloody sangudaemon personifies death by blood loss, while the skeletal thanadaemon represents death from old age. The most powerful daemons are the olethrodaemons, who represent the massive deaths caused by apocalypses and the end of entire worlds.
Daemons often carry soul gems either as trophies or for powering an ability. Cacodaemons are the most common source for soul gems, but they can also be created by spells like bind soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem to power an ability, the trapped soul is released into the afterlife and can be resurrected normally.
Soul gems are traded in illicit markets, a tradition celestials and psychopomps alike find vile. Soul gems' value varies, but is generally worth an amount relative to the level of a gem's captive soul.
Daemons embody a fundamental paradox—while they are incarnations of death and seek to devour all that lives, they are themselves living creatures. Some speak of a glorious end time after which reality will finally be free of the contagion that is life itself. Most daemons give no thought to this paradox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Changeling Exile.
This changeling exile is the child of a night hag or dreamthief hag.
As changelings come of age, they sometimes manifest abilities granted by their hag heritage. Some gain the ability to see in the dark, some grow fingernails long and hard enough to serve as claws, and others gain even stranger abilities specific to their hag mother. For instance, dream mays, the children of night hags or their cousins the dreamthief hags, can gain an enhanced ability to resist the magic of dreams and sleep. Other types of changelings include slag mays, the children of annis hags; callow mays, the children of green hags; brine mays, the children of sea hags; and others for each type of hag. As beings infused with supernatural power, changelings find themselves able to command various traditions of magic, with many drawn to either the occult magic common among hags or primal magic.
At roughly the same time in their lives, many changelings— women in particular—begin to hear the Call, a psychic urging from their hag mother luring them away from the communities that raised them. If followed, the Call eventually leads the changeling to the hag’s coven, where they are subjected to terrible rituals that twist them into hags themselves. Some changelings, especially those who have strong social bonds or embrace druidic traditions, are able to resist this Call and continue on with their mortal lives. The fact that the Call disproportionately targets female changelings has led to a widespread misunderstanding that all changelings are female, while in fact male changelings are simply assumed to be members of their paternal ancestry.
Changelings who resist the Call and abandon the society that raised them become exiles like the one presented on this page—creatures who live solitary lives in the wild and are often driven to desperate measures to survive, taking up the lifestyles of highway bandits or risk-taking wilderness guides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Charau-ka Acolyte of Angazhan.
Even with the Gorilla King’s fall, some charau-kas still worship Angazhan.
Until recently, most charau-kas were united under the rulership of Ruthazek the Gorilla King, a powerful warlord and champion of Angazhan who ruled from the city of Usaro. But when adventurers challenged and defeated Ruthazek, the charau-ka nation fragmented and the clans scattered into the jungle, each led by their own individual warlords.
Charau-kas generally dwell in small tribes consisting of a few dozen members. They often keep dangerous jungle creatures as pets or guardians, trusting their rangers or animal handlers to keep these deadly beasts under control. It’s not uncommon to find a group of charau-kas who cage a wild beast in the midst of their village, sacrificing victims to the imprisoned creature or tormenting it by holding it as a living trophy of sorts. A typical charau-ka village extends from the jungle floor up into the canopy above, and usually includes several treehouse-style structures connected by vines or rope bridges.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Describe a Charau-ka Warrior.
A charau-ka warrior carries hatchets, daggers, and similar weaponry on their person and usually doesn’t worry about running out of thrown weapons when rocks plucked from the ground are just as deadly in their hands.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Chernobue.
The chernobue infects all creatures it encounters with itself, spreading pain and calamity wherever it flops and writhes. It sheds ruin and sups on anguish, but a chernobue can sometimes be persuaded to pause for a few moments of conversation if its partner in discourse can keep its attention by providing enough atrocious details. Resembling a tumor-like growth of oily blackness, this vile monstrosity has numerous muscular tentacles, a single glaring baleful eye, and a drooling, toothy maw in the middle of its body.
The qlippoth presented here are but a small fraction of the squirming awfulness that lurks in the deeper rifts of the Abyss. Other types of qlippoth include multi-armed, crab-like gongorinans, which use living creatures as incubators; shapeshifting utukku, which infiltrate and undermine religions; death-spawned behimirons, which slay the living to reproduce; and the living siege engines known as catabolignes. Yet most frightening of all is the immense iathavos, a monster so abhorrent that even the Abyss cannot bear to allow more than one to exist at any one time.
Qlippoth ruled the Abyss for eons and still see themselves as its rightful rulers. When the Abyss first began to spawn demons from the souls of sinful humanoids, the realm was plunged into a brutal war spanning untold millennia, in which qlippoth, though more powerful and established, were slowly but surely driven back by the endless demonic hordes who spawned far more quickly than qlippoth could ever hope to match. Today, qlippoth have been driven to the deepest, darkest corners of the Abyss where they cling tightly to the crumbling remains of their territory.
As qlippoth lost territory to their demonic rivals, they realized that the only way to stem the tide of demonic forces was to starve them of the sinful souls that the Abyss uses to spawn new demons. While qlippoth have no concept of how they might go about preventing sin by changing the way mortals act, they do understand that exterminating mortal life would solve the problem as well.
The most powerful qlippoth are quasi-deities themselves, ancient entities only rarely worshipped by non-qlippoth. Of these monstrous divinities, the Polymorph Plague, Yamasoth, is the most well-known. Others include Chavazvug the Crawling Inferno, Isph-Aun-Vuln the Feaster Within, and Thuskchoon the Everglutton.
Although it is widely accepted that qlippoth have lost incalculable territory in the Abyss to demonkind, these fiends still control vast regions in the deepest reaches of that plane. Some sages suggest the troubling possibility that perhaps qlippoth still hold more territory of the Abyss than demons do, but because demons are more concerned with mortal life, we simply interact with the layers they control more often. For all we know, these dour sages postulate, the Abyss teems with endless swarms of qlippoth that have yet to make their move against mortal life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Chimera.
The chimera is the archetypal example of an unnatural monster made up of a monstrous mix of wildly different component creatures: in this case, a lion, a dragon, and a goat. Wild, hateful, and hungry, it tries to eat any creature it sees, but sometimes a strong-willed master is able to compel a chimera to serve as a guardian or even a mount.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Chimpanzee Visitant.
Common circus animals viewed as expendable by their caretakers are perhaps the most likely to rise as visitants. Animals that die en masse—such as in a tent fire or other disaster—can even form packs of roving undead.
These undead monsters haunt the sites of their demise and search out the masters who made their lives so hellish with only one goal in mind: vengeance. When they can’t locate their particular abuser, or if they are still unable to rest even after confronting their aggressor, visitants seek out similarly evil harmers of animals, becoming torturers of torturers. However, visitants are for the most part unable to distinguish between individual members of a species; thus, if a visitant was abused by a human trainer, any human that crosses its path may become a target of its rage.
A visitant resembles a zombified animal, but it retains a spark of the animal intelligence it had in life, making it all the more dangerous as a result. Visitants’ bodies are marred by the horrors of their brutal existences: Their mouths are furrowed in a constant snarl, with a black ichor dripping from their cracked, rotten lips. Whip scars from their hours of “training” glow with an unnatural purple light. And perhaps above all, their eyes mark them as touched by undeath—sunken horribly deep into their skull, leaking blood or other fluid, and glowing with an aura of dread and palpable anger.
You can modify visitants by applying the following abilities. Most visitants have one of these abilities, but more powerful visitants might have more, in which you might consider increasing the visitant’s level and statistics.
Noxious Breath The visitant exhales sharply, releasing pungent fumes from its lungs in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (sickened 2 on a critical failure).
Roar (auditory, concentrate, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental, primal) The visitant lets out a loud and horrifying roar. Each creature within 100 feet must attempt at a Will save. No matter the result, affected creatures are then temporarily immune to the effect for 1 minute.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is frightened 1.
Failure The creature is frightened 2.
Critical Failure The creature is frightened 3.
Vengeful Presence (aura, emotion, enchantment, mental) 20 feet. A creature that starts its turn within the visitant’s aura must succeed at a Will save or be overcome with a thirst for vengeance. For 1d4 rounds (1 minute on a critical failure), if the affected creature was attacked within the last round (whether or not the attack hit), the creature must use at least 1 action per round to Strike or use a hostile action toward its last attacker as long as the attacker is still alive. Failure to do so deals the affected creature 1d6 mental damage, plus 1d6 for every 5 levels the visitant has.
Wrestle The visitant makes a claw Strike against a creature it has grabbed. If the attack hits, that creature is knocked prone.
To create a visitant animal, use one of the stat blocks on this page as a starting point. Adjust the size as necessary and give its Strikes reach if it’s Huge or larger. Visitants can also be made using a zombie stat block as a base; in this case, adjust the creature’s Intelligence to –4. All visitants have imprecise lifesense as an additional sense.
Some visitants can cast the following innate occult spells. If you give a visitant the following spells, consider removing one of its other special abilities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Choker.
With long, cartilaginous limbs and gray skin, chokers easily hide in stony alcoves, rocky fissures, and darkened staircases to ambush their prey. The strange little aberrations prefer to pick off weak and solitary creatures, especially those that wander off from their packs or communities. A choker's long, spongy arms are flexible but deceptively strong. The fingers can tighten rapidly and are ridged with spiky, tooth-like structures that provide an incredible grip. A choker typically strangles its prey to death, then drags the body off or dismembers it using crude tools if the body is too big to carry. If confronted or outnumbered, a choker tries to escape, often compressing into a tight passage to get away. Chokers that encounter humanoids exhibit intense curiosity about their culture, society, and the products of art and industry. This interest isn't very deep—it just results in chokers that like killing people and collecting any of their items that seem sophisticated, such as jewelry, nice clothing, or written texts.
Chokers sometimes gather in settlements, usually sticking to slums or abandoned structures. These chokers stalk at night, flopping across rooftops, tapping at windows, and scuttling through sewers, gutters, and chimneys to get at prey. An urban choker that finds prey early on its hunt—a wandering pet, a person who is out alone—might spend the rest of the night indulging its curiosity about the products of society. A curious choker might abscond with all sorts of odd items, from tavern signs to library books to roof tiles. A choker usually pilfers only one item at a time, but as its collection grows, it might need to find a larger nest to accommodate its collection, then move its pieces one by one to the new home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Choral (Choir Angel).
Choral angels are incredible singers who fill the halls of Nirvana with pious chants and sacred hymns. They form from the souls of talented bards and other performers. While they shy away from conflict, they occasionally brave the mortal realm to deliver good omens and auspicious messages. Choral angels often serve the goddess Shelyn, but they can also serve other good deities and empyreal lords.
The most powerful angels belong to a category of demigods known as the empyreal lords—a title shared with other powerful good-aligned demigods among the host of archons, azatas, and other inhabitants of the celestial planes. The most powerful and most well-known of the angelic empyreal lords is Sarenrae.
Angels normally live on Nirvana or other celestial planes, but their missions can bring them to the Material Plane. Spellcasters can conjure them for aid or advice in times of need, and they can even be found, if rarely, crusading against fiends in Hell, the Abyss, or anywhere in between.
Many angels wear exquisite armor or wield beautiful and often magical weapons. While they are not hampered by mortal sins like greed or pride (save for the very rare and tragic exception), they do enjoy the beauty of fine clothing, exquisite jewelry, and works of art.
The most powerful angels are known as the solars, but numerous others can be found in Nirvana working their own missions or goals. Angels generally appear as beautiful, often somewhat androgynous humanoids, and the most powerful often possess two or even four sets of feathered wings.
Three types of devas exist among the angelic host, all of which serve as angelic “field agents.” Of the types of angels, devas are the ones most likely to be encountered dwelling somewhere other than Nirvana, as these angels focus their work on cultivating and protecting goodness in mortal souls, be they living or dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Chupacabra.
These notorious predators have an undeniable thirst for blood. Chupacabras prefer to prey upon the weak and slow, often hiding in wait and watching potential prey for long periods before attacking. Spry and stealthy, they most often make their homes in areas of high grass and protective rock, their slightly reflective scales allowing them to blend in well with such surroundings.
Chupacabras prefer to eat lone travelers and farm animals (particularly goats), and leave little evidence of their presence apart from the grisly, blood-drained husks of their meals. Their tendency to stay out of sight combined with their naturally nocturnal activity often leads superstitious locals to conclude the worst, imagining that a particularly reckless vampire lives in the area.
A typical chupacabra measures nearly 5-1/2 feet from its muzzle to the tip of its spiny tail, and it stands just under 4 feet tall. With their slight build and lightweight bones, most weigh close to 100 pounds. They mate rarely and only during the hottest months, with the females each producing a single egg that hatches into a tiny, dehydrated creature. The mother typically leaves helpless prey in her cave so the hatchling can immediately feed.
Although chupacabras are typically solitary creatures, they have been known to form small gangs in bountiful areas. Members of these groups work well together, growing bold enough to attack larger animals, small herds, and otherwise more dangerous prey. Stories of chupacabras attacking travelers or laying siege to farmhouses typically stem from the hunting practices of such gangs. Regions where chupacabra activity like this is more common often have complex and colorful myths and tall tales about chupacabra capabilities or motive —- and a few of the claims, such as that some chupacabras can fly, are all too true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Chuul.
Also known as chu'ulothis, these large, armor-plated, crustacean predators lurk beneath the surface of pools, mires, and ponds, waiting to snatch up prey with their massive claws before paralyzing them with their tentacles. At that point, they begin to feed, eating their quarry alive.
Chuuls can live in fresh or saltwater, and indeed are found in aquatic environs the world over—even in the subterranean oceans and lakes of the Darklands. While chuuls are good swimmers, they prefer terrestrial prey. Their preferred method of hunting is by lunging out of the water, paralyzing their victims with their poison-coated tentacles, then gleefully dragging their twitching food into the water to drown if they cannot simply eat such morsels alive. Chuuls that dwell aboveground prefer to dine on lizardfolk, while those swimming the subterranean lakes of the Darklands readily eat anything but xulgaths, whose flavor and stink they find off-putting.
Chuuls are capable of speech and reason, but these creatures rarely speak with those outside their species except to taunt their food. Before it begins consuming its prey, a chuul often speaks in a gurgling, nearly incomprehensible dialect about how it will enjoy feasting on the creature's flesh. Perhaps chuuls believe that insults and degradation lead to more tender and tastier food, but the truth will likely never be known; almost all chuuls stubbornly refuse any meaningful conversation, even when imprisoned and compelled by treats or pain.
It is unknown if a chuul society exists beyond their frenzied mating season. Chuuls' intellects seem devoted only toward eating, causing psychological pain to sentient creatures, decorating their lairs with mementos of their favorite meals and victories, and breeding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cinder Rat.
These oversized rodents are made of smoldering charcoal and elemental fire, and noxious fumes continually bellow from their flaming flesh.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
More than other elementals, fire elementals tend to deviate from neutrality, and are often good, evil, or chaotic in nature. Lawful fire elementals are rare. Fire's inherently capricious nature seems to prevent these creatures from succumbing to the influence of order.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Often, nothing remains after defeating a fire elemental but a pile of ashes and the fading smell of smoke. But sometimes, fragments of their elemental power remain behind. At the GM's discretion, a fire elemental can leave behind ashes, lumps of charcoal, or ever-smoldering cinders that are valuable components for the construction of fire-themed magic items.
Though fire and water classically oppose one another, in the right mixture they can become a dangerous combination. Water elementals heated to a scalding temperature through natural factors such as underwater volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent fire damage with their Strikes, while fire elementals infused with moisture might exude clouds of obscuring or even blinding steam.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Clay Golem.
Traditionally, clay golems are crafted in the image of a deity and used as guardians of tombs or sacred crypts. Clay golems have the power to lay curses upon their victims as punishment for intrusion, leading many to believe that these oft-ancient constructs have a touch of the divine to them. While this idea has little basis in reality, superstitious folk still tread lightly around statues that resemble clay golems even in the slightest.
The animating force within a clay golem is unusually unstable, making the golem prone to entering a berserk frenzy when damaged. Entire treasuries have been totally ruined as a result of a rampaging clay golem, so crafters do well to make sure their golems are maintained and in good working order—or otherwise place them on the other side of the door from the treasures they wish to protect.
Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called “golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.
Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell can affect the golem.
Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.
Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.
Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cloaker.
Weird and paranoid creatures that dwell in the Darklands, cloakers resemble hideous, flying manta rays. Crafty and careful hunters, their motivations, their patterns of attack, and even their societies and history are often an inscrutable jumble of contradicting reports, confused rumors, and terrifying accounts.
Like many of the stranger creatures of Golarion, cloakers were originally created by the alghollthus, who bred them to spy on their Azlanti thralls. Upon the fall of the Azlanti empire, the alghollthus cast out their cloaker creations, who, in turn, fled to the lower reaches of the Darklands. Amid the vaults and twisted corridors of their new home, their attitudes—particularly regarding their apprehension toward their former masters—changed dramatically. Suspicion became paranoia, egotism, sadism, and much worse. Now, most cloakers lead solitary lives, stalking the Darklands for easy prey and delving deeper into internal horrors. Their paranoia is so great that they interact only rarely even with their own kind, encountering another cloaker only briefly to mate before flitting back to isolation.
But there are exceptions. Every so often, a charismatic cloaker priest can call together a dark cabal of these creatures and other Darklands denizens to worship unspeakable ancient gods. These rare cloakers whip their acolytes and followers into a frenzy of dark rituals and heinous acts. While these cults are depraved and destructive, they rarely survive longer than their founder.
Cloakers isolate themselves within the deeper parts of the Darklands and are concentrated in Sekamina and Orv. They tend to avoid Nar‑Voth due to its proximity to the surface.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Clockwork Assassin.
Exceptionally efficient and utterly merciless, clockwork assassins carry out their murderous directives with mechanical precision. Though they can disguise themselves, upon close inspection, they're plainly artificial, with just a single eye and weapons integrated into their arms.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cloud Giant.
The graceful and regal cloud giants have skin of milky white to powdery blue. Unlike most giants, cloud giants are quite morally diverse. A handful are neutral, but of the others, roughly half are good, while the other half are evil. Good cloud giants are often civic-minded builders of roads and settlements, and are interested in trading goods as well as cultural innovations. It’s not uncommon for such giants to approach their neighbors with diplomacy and build strong relationships with other peaceful peoples. Conversely, evil cloud giants are often isolationist and xenophobic. Preferring hidden mountain valleys and settlements in the caves and among the crags of lonely peaks, they raid for what they want and treat other creatures like inconsequential insects. These opposing philosophies can generate a great deal of strife among neighboring cloud giant communities, and the raiders often threaten the trade deals of their peaceful cousins.
Legends persist of floating cities ruled by magically gifted cloud giant queens and kings. While most cloud giants plainly state that such claims are pure fantasy, others are mysteriously tight-lipped or evasive about the matter.
Giants often keep an eclectic collection of treasures in their knapsacks or bags. Among these can be found a staggeringly wide range of unexpected and odd treasures and valuables.
As oversized as they are, giants tend to dwell in remote regions of the world, where they have the luxury of claiming larger territories of their own.
As with many people, giants enjoy keeping pets. Yet for giants, what constitutes a pet is often categorized as beast to others. Large animals like bears and lions, and megafauna like woolly mammoths and dinosaurs are popular, as are more magical creatures like hell hounds, manticores, griffons, and the like.
Beyond the giants detailed here, many others dwell in remote regions of the world. Marsh giants are cultists who worship strange sea deities, shadow giants have ties to the Shadow Plane, and mountain giants are horrific butchers even other giants fear.
Giants are larger-than-life foes. While many giants have themes that tie them to elemental or magical forces, the primary theme giants share is that they embody a classic cultural trope as their basis. Fire giants, for example, can be seen as oversized smiths, while hill giants should evoke the flavor of an oversized bully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cobbleswarm.
Cobble mites look like stones or rocks with small mouths that resemble the inside of geodes. Tiny, unassuming, and typically harmless, they reside in mountains and cavernous regions, subsisting on scraps of food and gravel. When dozens of cobble mites congregate, they use their collective might to overwhelm and consume small creatures, much like a school of hungry piranhas attacking and devouring unfortunate animals.
Cobbleswarms, also known as stone flocks or rock hives, typically live simple existences. However, some cobble mites end up pulled from their native mountainsides or caverns. Humanoids tend to see cobble mites as endearing little creatures and sometimes take one as a pet. Because cobbleswarms have consistent, smooth shapes, they're sometimes inadvertently collected for use in road building and other construction. Other times, cobble mites simply get lost after wandering far from their home territory. Lone cobble mites have an uncanny knack for finding each other, especially when forming a cobbleswarm.
Most cobbleswarms living in urban environments hide among cobbled city streets. They consume the rocks caught in the grooves of boots and food dropped by pedestrians. Cobble mites are tough creatures that can endure being trodden upon uninjured. Some streets bear several cobble mites that even locals don't suspect, as the creatures stay well-fed enough to refrain from moving much or causing trouble. Loud explosions frighten cobble mites, and many cobbleswarms lash out during firework displays, mostly due to fear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cockatrice.
Ugly and aggressive, the dread cockatrice stalks garbage pits and hillside dumps in search of prey that it can turn to stone with its petrifying beak and subsequently consume piece by broken piece. Cockatrices resemble gaunt and sickly roosters with bat wings and serpentine tails, and they rarely grow more than 2 feet tall and twice as long. Their absentminded clucking gives smart prey ample warning of their presence, and when angered cockatrices let out a shrill crow like that of a rooster. Their peck releases a magical toxin that causes flesh to quickly calcify, and any creature pecked repeatedly by an irritable cockatrice eventually transforms into a stone statue of itself.
The first cockatrice is rumored to have hatched from a rooster’s egg incubated on a dung hill by a toad. Whether or not the rumor is true, the cockatrice’s monstrous appearance certainly doesn’t contradict its strange and filthy origin story, and these creatures are more than capable of propagating on their own. Cockatrices are remarkably fecund and gather in flocks of up to a dozen members. Each flock contains only a few females. The males—which differ in appearance from the females by having warty wattles and gnarled combs— often fight with each other, with lower-ranking males eventually driven away to find their own lairs or compete among other flocks. Most creatures who run afoul of a solitary cockatrice do so with one of these surly outcasts.
Cockatrice lairs are often littered with fragments of statuary from past victims—although these are as likely to be remnants of frogs, lizards, and insects as people. Curiously, weasels and ferrets, who infiltrate cockatrice lairs to steal their eggs, are immune to the creatures’ petrifying bites. For unknown reasons, cockatrices are both terrified of and enraged by conventional roosters, and they are equally likely to flee or attack when confronted by one.
Particularly brave (or foolhardy) individuals sometimes keep cockatrices as pets or guard animals. In their natural habitat among plains, forests, and sewers near humanoid settlements, cockatrices are content to live off vermin or scraps of waste, but their greatest pleasure is consuming warm meals of freshly petrified flesh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cockroach Swarm.
While cockroaches tend to gather in cramped spaces, a disturbed colony is sometimes prone to swarming, where hundreds or even thousands of the insects scurry out of their hiding places in a raft of shiny brown and black carapaces on thousands of skittering legs. Given how disgusting many find cockroaches to be, encountering such a swarm can be alarming to even the most seasoned adventurers. The creatures are relentless when disturbed; in contrast to the insects' normally skittish and harmless nature, as swarms they pursue the creature or creatures that provoked them and harry them with thousands of stinging bites.
Beyond the common giant cockroach, other flesh-eating cockroaches exist throughout the world. These variations include the giant hissing cockroach, the noxious venomroach, the huge spitting cockroach (which can incapacitate enemies from a distance), the aggressive sawback cockroach, and the mysterious and rare dragonroach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Coil Spy.
Some serpentfolk undergo intense ritual training and practice to improve their innate ability to disguise themselves. These serpentfolk often identify as members of a sinister society known as the Coils of Ydersius, and the most devoted of their number seek out methods of reincarnating into new forms to even more efficiently infiltrate enemy societies. But before such agents take this extreme step, they must prove themselves as Coil spies. These serpentfolk train in methods of infiltrating other societies to such an extent that they might be capable of infiltrating a mammalian civilization for years. Though they're expected to work entirely toward the eventual triumph of their people, most Coil spies also find personal pursuits to keep them occupied in the shorter term. When Coil spies get caught, it's rarely due to a lack of pure skill, but rather to their arrogance or recklessness as they pursue their hedonistic desires.
Today, the central realm of the Darklands retains the old name of the serpentfolk empire that once dominated this region—Sekamina. This name is also the source of the serpentfolk’s Aklo title, sekmin, which they are often called in ancient texts. Sekamina itself retains very little of the serpentfolk’s legacy, its mantle of rule having passed on to others like drow, ghouls, gugs, and deep gnomes. Yet in remote reaches of this dangerous realm, the ruins of serpentfolk cities still stand. Within, a great many serpentfolk sleep in torpor in secluded vaults, with only a few cells awake to enact their schemes. In addition, a small number of serpentfolk settlements dot Golarion’s surface, most of them in humid, remote jungles, far-flung islands, or caverns close to the surface. It’s rare for such a settlement to number more than a few dozen serpentfolk. They rely primarily on slaves to build their power bases, to defend them, and to perform essentially all the practical functions of their society. This includes providing food, crafting goods, and tending to the serpentfolk’s every need.
Zyss serpentfolk are megalomaniacal geniuses with dreams of returning to their place of dominance, though modern serpentfolk have few means of accomplishing this goal. Many of their plans hinge on resurrecting Ydersius, their decapitated god. His headless body still thrashes about, mindless, in the Darklands, waiting to be reunited with his lost skull. Serpentfolk numbers are so small that reclaiming their dominance seems a distant dream, especially since their reproduction is slow. Though a parent can birth a dozen young at once, the gestation period lasts up to a decade, and the likelihood that even one will be zyss is low. There’s no telling whether a child will be zyss or aapoph, regardless of parentage. A coveted zyss child is just as likely to arise from aapoph parents as from two zyss, and every serpentfolk colony has someone in charge of sorting the young, identifying the earliest signs of intelligence in them.
Though the number of zyss is small in serpentfolk colonies, bringing in more zyss isn’t necessarily desirable. A serpentfolk conclave with just a few zyss is functional, but one with a large number becomes fractious. Cults and societies form, all pursuing their own passions and politics, with scheming and backstabbing running rampant. A powerful priest may be able to bring other zyss to heel, but many zyss question why a priest should be in charge if their god is dead. Zyss thrive on selfish desires for hedonistic pleasure and adulation. They feel no love for others, even their offspring. Thriving on decadence, they crave receiving expensive gifts, gorging themselves on massive meals, and pursing arts such as music, poetry, or sculpture. Even more academic hobbies, like the study of magic or warfare, take an artistic bent, like carefully designing colorful illusions or memorizing epic poems about renowned wars. Each zyss believes themself to have more refined tastes than their peers.
Some serpentfolk might have entirely different innate spells. These alternative spells are typically illusions, enchantments, or divinations like dream message, enthrall, glibness, invisibility, mindlink, mind probe, mind reading, mislead, phantom pain, or zealous conviction. Aapoph serpentfolk lack innate spells.
Ydersius was defeated by an Azlanti heroine named Savith in the era before Earthfall, and now the so-called Headless King's body prowls aimlessly in the Darklands. That the decapitated god's clerics still gain power from worship points to Ydersius's tenacity and continued existence, after a fashion. Those who seek to recover his skull and return it to his body hope that doing so will restore both him and the sekmin civilization to their full power.
The war between the humans of ancient Azlant and the serpentfolk of Sekamina waged on for years. The serpentfolk's defeat threw their society into chaos and undermined their conviction that they would continue to rule simply because they had done so for eons. For millennia, serpentfolk have remained in hiding in their underground fortresses, but many feel it is time to rise again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Compsognathus.
The compsognathus is a small bipedal dinosaur that moves in swift, darting motions. Its bite injects a venom that causes numbness and weakness, a trait that the animal uses to bring down larger prey, although it prefers to scavenge food or snatch up insects and other smaller creatures for its meals. The compsognathus is curious to a fault; most encounters that result in combat with these diminutive dinosaurs result not from the creatures' hunger but from frightened defensive reactions when the dinosaurs' inquisitive natures compel them to enter into situations (such as wagons or bedrolls) that inadvertently put them at odds with surprised adventurers.
A compsognathus measures 3 feet long from its head to the tip of its tail and weighs 15 pounds. It is small enough to serve as a house pet or even as a familiar for a spellcaster. In cases where magical links aren't involved, however, those encountering or keeping the creatures would be well-advised to treat them with the same caution one might extend to a pet viper or other poisonous reptile, as they are at best partly tame.
While the real world fossil records hold a wealth of inspiration for the reconstruction of dinosaurs in an RPG, you can also look to living creatures for ideas. Giving a dinosaur a poisonous bite or an unusual attack routine like Clobbering Charge ensures that dinosaurs are as interesting in combat as they are in appearance.
As with most animals, dinosaurs can be tamed or domesticated, but the difficulty of this task increases along with the dinosaur’s level. Lizardfolk and orcs are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, workhorses, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In certain cities, dinosaurs are popularly featured as combatants in blood sports and other gladiatorial battles.
As animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear. Dinosaurs can also be harvested for rare and valuable trophies such as teeth, talons, armor plates, and the like.
At first glance, the inclusion of dinosaurs in a fantasy setting might seem strange, but dinosaurs are an excellent creature to use in a game that bridges the gap between familiar real-world animals and legendary monsters. If having dinosaurs mix freely with lions, manticores, and dragons still seems strange to you, consider having them dwell in remote, primeval lands, as suggested in the sidebars on pages 99–100. On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in the wilder regions of the world, particularly on the continent of Garund, though they are common enough that PCs might find some on display in a menagerie in a northern city, in use as guardian creatures, or even kept by druids as loyal animal companions.
Another classic place that dinosaurs are found in fiction are in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal place to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day‑night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam.
In a fantasy setting, magical effects or supernatural influences can enhance dinosaurs by giving them unexpected attacks, modes of movement, or other abilities. You can quickly create a memorable magical beast simply by giving a dinosaur the magical attack of another creature of an equal level, such as a spinosaurus gaining an acidic breath weapon akin to that of an adult black dragon.
A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or a quick online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well. Armor-headed pachycephalosaurs, spike-thumbed iguanodons, duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed spinosauruses, and more await discovery by those who would seek out the mysteries of the lost worlds where the thunder lizards still rule!
Dinosaurs fit well into certain types of settings. They’re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cornugon (Horned Devil).
<a href="Planes.aspx?ID=18" style="text-decoration:underline">Hell's</a> armies contain legions upon legions of different devils all suited precisely to their roles. But such an army needs able commanders, and it is this role that cornugons fill. Their mere presence inspires those under their command to improved performance— often through fear of the horrible torments that a cornugon can unleash as punishment for failure. Forged in the fires of Malebolge from the most renowned warriors among lesser devilkind, even the least cornugon is among the fiercest warriors of the multiverse. The greatest among them on occasion ascend further still, becoming those rare and feared legends of Hell called malebranche.
At any one time, eight archdevils rule the eight upper layers of Hell, while the deepest layer is ruled by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a unique demigod with a dedicated role in guiding the infernal machine forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city. Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries, and Belial designs new weapons for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the oldest archdevil and keeper of many secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs armies. Baalzebul is a brooding archdevil who has fallen from Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty Mephistopheles was formed from the plane of Hell itself.
Many unique and powerful devils hold positions of power in Hell. The most numerous of these are the infernal dukes, many of whom were promoted to this position from already impressive statures as pit fiends. The supreme ruler of Hell itself is Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness. Between these two tiers rule the eight archdevils—see the sidebar on the facing page.
The nine layers of Hell are the planar home of all devils, and they much prefer its tyrannically ordered environs to anywhere else in the multiverse. Yet devils can be encountered anywhere mortals can be tempted by infernal bargains or seek diabolic aid. On Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is particularly aligned with Hell. Its government is based upon Hellʼs organization, and the state church is that of Asmodeus.
Devils view daemonsʼ constant hunt for souls as a short-sighted waste of potential, and demonsʼ chaotic destruction of society and flesh as uncivilized and obnoxious, but they do not loathe their fiendish counterparts. Indeed, most devils are more than willing to take advantage of daemons and demons as they can to further their own machinations.
Stinking, sulfurous hellfire is infused with evil. Hellfire always deals a combination of fire damage and evil damage, though the specific ratio depends on the hellfire's origin. Certain types of hellfire can impose other effects on creatures as well, such as sapping their strength or memories.
While travel to and from Hell is possible with plane shift, another way to reach and traverse the infernal realms is via hellmouths, strange living portals connecting different layers or even different planes. A hellmouth takes the form of a grimacing face, distended maw, or other distressingly organic aperture, and no two share the same appearance. Most are carefully guarded, but some new or well-hidden hellmouths have yet to be discovered.
The devils presented on these pages are a small sampling of the torments Hell has to offer. Other devils, like the inquisition-focused bone devils, the cherub-faced and fly-bodied accuser devils, and the aquatic drowning devil are a few examples of these widespread immortal creatures.
The four queens of the night wield great power in the Pit. Ardad Lili is a plotter and manipulator with ambitions of ruling the heavens, while Doloras revels in suffering. Most distant is Mahathallah, watching over fate and death. Mightiest among them is Eiseth, who is assembling an army in Dis in the hopes of claiming the iron throne of Malebolge.
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little use for compassion or empathy. As such, it exists entirely within a strict hierarchy, and this order extends to its denizens. While different types of demons correspond to various sins and daemons are associated with modes of mortal death, the different types of devils exist solely to fulfill particular roles in the infernal machine. On occasion, a particular devil can transcend the role for which they were literally shaped, but this often transforms the devil physically into the type suitable for their new role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Counteflora.
The counteflora resembles an oversized dandelion with black flowers and sinister patterns on its bracts, which it can contract for additional protection and to turn its flower head into a deadly bashing weapon. Unlike dandelions, countefloras do not have separate flowering and seeding stages, and can release their intoxicating seedpods as long as their bracts are open.
Countefloras exhibit a strange intellect and communicate with one another by releasing invisible pheromones into the air. Alone, a desperate counteflora may ally with another creature if it is offered water or fertile soil. Contrary to popular belief, countefloras absorb sunlight for sustenance; they do not attack other creatures to feast upon them. Rather, the reason countefloras go to such lengths to kill their opponents is to fertilize the surrounding soil and create a nutrient-rich environment for their seedpods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Crag Linnorm.
Despite being among the weakest linnorms, the crag linnorm is a devastating predator, capable of quickly cooking its foes with its magma breath.
The death curses of the linnorms are often the subjects of tragic sagas, and those who would think themselves vanquishing heroes for slaying a linnorm often meet their dooms soon thereafter, succumbing to these curses well after the death of the linnorm responsible for bestowing it.
Linnorms have a deep connection to the First World, the primordial home of the fey. While linnorms typically won't think twice before devouring a gnome or other fey, they do have an unusual respect for wielders of powerful primal magic. The only way to cow a linnorm, according to common wisdom, is to remind it that there are forces of nature even stronger than itself.
In the storied Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the slaying of a linnorm is traditionally required for those who would claim a nation’s crown. Recently, though, the Linnorm King White Estrid claimed her crown not by slaying a linnorm but by beating it into submission, gaining a powerful and dangerous ally to help secure her rule.
Creatures as powerful as linnorms tend to spawn stories of their own, accurate or not. Critical failure on a check to Recall Knowledge on linnorms might suggest that you can avoid a linnorm's death curse by closing your eyes as you deliver the fatal blow, or that rubbing poison oak on yourself can ward off a linnorm's attention.
As with true dragons, linnorms tend to amass immense piles of treasure in their lairs. These hoards consist of the weapons, gear, and belongings of would-be vanquishers more often than minted coins or works of art.
Almost all linnorms lead solitary lives; they are too reprehensible for even their own kind to tolerate for any length of time. Most species do not even meet to reproduce; rather, female linnorms usually deposit a solitary egg in a remote location, which a wandering male linnorm then fertilizes and places in a nook suitable for incubation. Newborn linnorms range in size from that of adult crocodiles to full-grown bulls, and their growth is rapid. Even a juvenile linnorm is strong enough to wreak havoc on a small settlement— though most don't dare to commit such audacious pillaging, for fear of evoking the anger of another, larger linnorm in the area.
Linnorms exist in a variety of forms beyond the four detailed here. The gaunt cairn linnorm, the spiny taiga linnorm, and the aquatic fjord linnorm each terrorize their own specific regions of the Material Plane.
While the linnorms presented here and in the first Bestiary constitute the majority of these creatures, others exist, particularly in the remote regions of the First World. It may be that these rare linnorms simply find the Material Plane too constraining for their might!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Crawling Hand.
A crawling hand formed from the appendage of a Medium creature is quick and agile, skittering in the shadows until it can strike its prey.
A popular tale among necromancers tells of an ancient wizard who trafficked in evil magic. During a summoning ritual gone wrong, the wizard's hand became possessed and later strangled them while they slept. The hand dragged the corpse across the wizard's rooms to their workbench, propped up a knife in a vise, and severed itself from the rest of the body. According to the story, the hand went on to commit several more murders and disappeared into the sewers of a major metropolis, never to be seen again. Some necromancers believe that this original crawling hand still creeps through the shadows of that city, killing as it pleases<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Crimson Worm.
Among the most dangerous cave worms are the fiery crimson worms. In addition to being even larger than azure or purple worms, the crimson worm has a penchant for burrowing through volcanic regions that, over the generations, have infused it with a supernatural link to the Elemental Plane of Fire. The molten heart of an active volcano is an attractive lair for a crimson worm, as are the sprawling fields of bubbling magma found in the deepest reaches of the Darklands. Legends from ancient peoples, precursor dwarven societies, and colonists of the Elemental Planes populated moats of lava with crimson worms likely have some basis in truth, although the methods such ancients used to keep these “moat worms” contained and prevented them from chewing their way through fortress foundations must have been significant.
Crimson worms sometimes frequent areas on the surface where volcanism creates hot springs or other geothermal features, but even then they prefer to spend most of their time burrowing through the ground in their never-ending search for sustenance. Surface lands claimed by crimson worms are notable for the mound-shaped burrows these creatures leave behind as they dig.
The adventure need not end simply because the party was ingloriously swallowed whole by a giant cave worm. Perhaps the PCs find an undigested item that helps them survive the inhospitable environ, or maybe the worm regurgitates them in a cavern far off from where they started. Whatever the specifics, you can easily draw from folklore and popular fiction to create your own "belly of the worm" adventure for heroes who wind up on the wrong side of the monster’s scales.
Cave worms are notoriously dim witted, driven primarily by purely animalistic needs to feed and reproduce. This hasn’t prevented attempts to use them as guardians for their lairs, if not to tame them. Magic can be used to maintain control over a worm, but gifted, patient, and brave animal trainers can condition cave worms to serve in all manner of roles, such as living siege engines, shocking methods of executing foes, or merely pets.
Some societies view the immense cave worms as natural disasters or incarnations of wrathful gods. Cave worms that have been active in a region often become part of that area’s local lore. For example, in the notorious Cinderlands of eastern Varisia, Shoanti have long told tales of Cindermaw, an immense crimson worm viewed by some as worthy of worship, and by others as the ultimate test of bravery.
Cave worms are infamous for being nearly unstoppable and for swallowing their prey whole. A cave worm also ingests earth and minerals as it tunnels. The worm processes some of these minerals, resulting in its armored hide and toxic sting, while it leaves others behind—often including treasure or other valuables that incidentally serve to lure explorers into the worm’s proximity and, more often than not, its gullet. While not completely mindless, cave worms are difficult to train, and most attempts to domesticate them (in theory, a cave worm would make an excellent mining resource) result in disaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Crocodile.
Crocodiles can be found basking on riverbanks, lurking in swamps, or floating in lakes. They are usually are indistinguishable from logs when viewed from afar—at least until they attack. Alligators have similar statistics, but because they often live in more temperate climates, they endure cold temperatures better. Unlike alligators, crocodiles can tolerate salt water. Both are formidable predators that are likely to devour careless adventurers who fail to watch where they step.
Crocodiles often live in warm, tropical areas, either in fresh or salt water. Alligators are found in more varied climates, but only in fresh water. Deinosuchuses, particularly the largest and most dangerous of their kind, prefer estuaries, bays, or other brackish bodies of water connected to both river and sea.
A crocodile’s skin can be used as leather, and its meat is chewy and mild, though even a large crocodile doesn’t usually yield more than 50 pounds of usable meat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Crucidaemon (Torture Daemon).
Of all the ways to die, crucidaemons represent perhaps one of the least desirable: death by torture. The fiend’s shapely body, which appears to be sculpted from iron or mithril, belies a sinister wrath and love of inflicting pain. Crucidaemons particularly enjoy inflicting pain with their curved, serrated daggers, which are attached to their bodies via a chain that pierces each wrist.
A crucidaemon’s existence is dedicated to subjecting its prey to an eternity of pain and terror. Unlike other daemons, many of which are eager to feed on mortal souls as soon as they can, the crucidaemon takes much greater pleasure in prolonging the agony of its victims. Oftentimes, a crucidaemon will inflict such torment and pain upon its prey that when the end finally comes, the victim tearfully thanks the daemon for the mercy of oblivion. An encounter with a crucidaemon that does not end with its death is far from over—crucidaemons have unequaled patience for those who dare oppose them.
While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals’ fear.
While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane of pure evil for only the most corrupt souls. If Hell is a realm of torture and systematic depravity, Abaddon is its twisted cousin—a place where one can find only misery and despair in ample quantities, with neither the strictures of Hell nor the chaotic freedom of the Abyss. For evildoers who seek simply to inflict their wickedness on others, Abaddon is a rich hunting ground where one can revel in turpitude, though visitors be forewarned: the competition is fierce.
The four Horsemen are the most powerful of the daemonic demigods, but they are only four of many. Far more daemonic harbingers dwell on Abaddon, each a unique and powerful demigod in their own right that enjoys sweeping influence among daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector (ruler of the slave city of Awaiting Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian (consort to the Horseman of Famine), and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame (patron to arsonists and agent of the Horseman of War) are but three of the dozens of harbingers who rule realms in Abaddon.
Each of the four Horsemen is served by a specific category of servitor daemons known as deacons. Leukodaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Pestilence. Meladaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Famine, while thanadaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Death. Purrodaemons are currently the most powerful of the deacons, and serve the Horseman of War—yet over time, which category of deacon is the most powerful can wax and wane.
Numerous powerful and unique daemon demigods, known collectively as harbingers, rule over swaths of Abaddon. Above these demigods, though, are entities of even greater power—the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. As the eons go on, the names and identities of specific horsemen change. Currently, they consist of Apollyon (Horseman of Pestilence), Charon (Horseman of Death), Szuriel (Horseman of War), and Trelmarixian (Horseman of Famine). Of these, only Charon has never fallen to an upstart. Some hold that a “Fifth Horseman” once ruled over the other four, while others maintain that the eternally eclipsed sun in the skies above Abaddon is all that remains of this long-dead god.
As many daemons exist as there are awful ways to die. The bloody sangudaemon personifies death by blood loss, while the skeletal thanadaemon represents death from old age. The most powerful daemons are the olethrodaemons, who represent the massive deaths caused by apocalypses and the end of entire worlds.
Daemons often carry soul gems either as trophies or for powering an ability. Cacodaemons are the most common source for soul gems, but they can also be created by spells like bind soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem to power an ability, the trapped soul is released into the afterlife and can be resurrected normally.
Soul gems are traded in illicit markets, a tradition celestials and psychopomps alike find vile. Soul gems' value varies, but is generally worth an amount relative to the level of a gem's captive soul.
Daemons embody a fundamental paradox—while they are incarnations of death and seek to devour all that lives, they are themselves living creatures. Some speak of a glorious end time after which reality will finally be free of the contagion that is life itself. Most daemons give no thought to this paradox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Culdewen.
Perpetually cursed to hunger and failure, a culdewen plies waterways in search of appealing fish to catch—the bigger the better. Of course, this diminutive, emaciated fey calls every living creature a “fish.” Only other fey are exempt, and they tend to consider culdewens lost causes. A culdewen can never find satisfaction. Each time they catch a fish, a magical curse forces them to hunt for an appealing spot to dine—an island, cove, or abandoned dock or shack where they can eat in peace. By the time they arrive, their catch will be gone. Every time. Forever.
A foul mood hovers over a culdewen, causing them to swear colorfully, smack things with their oar, and shake their tiny fists at the sky. Conversation with a culdewen is fruitless, as they talk in circles, speaking only of fishing and the weather. Capturing a “fish” gives a culdewen a rare moment of happiness; the culdewen capers and ululates, pleased with their catch, and rushes off to their boat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cu Sith.
Cu siths are hound-like doorkeepers of remote portals to other planes, particularly portals to the untamed realm of the fey, the First World. They are highly territorial and roam the highland moors they call home, constantly on the hunt for any creatures that might intrude on their territory. Those that bargain for safe passage to or from a portal find cu siths to be vigilant escorts that keep travelers safe from extraplanar threats but also ensure their charges don’t veer from the most direct path to their destination. Cu siths are highly proficient hunters, and to mortals they offer a single warning in the form of their terrifying bark. Creatures that refuse to flee upon hearing a cu sith’s warning bark risk a quick and brutal death.
Cu siths cut imposing figures; they are as large as bulls and covered in intertwining roots, plant matter, and shaggy green and white fur that terminates in a long, plaited tail. Their eyes glow with a fiery green light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cyclops.
The kingdoms of the cyclopes date to an age before the rise of humanity, when dragons and giants and serpentfolk ruled the world. The cyclopes built enormous stone cities and prayed to ancient gods of brutality and wrath, but their power to foresee the future failed them, and their civilization collapsed. Today, most cyclopes have virtually no knowledge of the former glory of their kind, even though it is not uncommon for them to dwell among the ruins of their greatness. Cyclops cities include monuments and imposing murals which depict their peoples’ history, but few now among them can read or interpret these relics of the past.
In addition to their single eye, cyclopes are also famous for their never-ending hunger, an appetite so all-consuming that some scholars theorize it may in fact be some kind of curse. The ever-present hunger of the cyclopes seems to have some connection to the death of their civilization—though whether this voracity was the cause or a side-effect of their people’s downfall is likely destined to remain a mystery.
Although details of the cyclopes’ gods have largely been lost to the annals of time, what little is known about these deities suggests they were vindictive and petty enough to curse their own people if they felt neglected or badly served.
Great cyclopes are traditionally violent creatures, but some retain fragments of the old ways that lull them into periods of calm. During such times, they can be incredible sources of information, but one must take care to be well away from the great cyclops’s lair before its bestial rage wakens once more.
Cyclopes dwell in or near the remains of their lost civilizations—notably Ghol-Gan in Garund, Koloran in northwestern Casmaron, and various kingdoms in Iblydos. Ruins of Ghol-Gan still dot the archipelago of the Shackles, and untold numbers of treasures belonging to the ancient cyclops empire still await discovery. Pirates and treasure hunters regularly conduct expeditions in search of lost Ghol-Gani relics, but many of these voyages never return. Among those that do, survivors speak of terrible curses, gruesome traps, and one-eyed undead guardians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Cythnigot.
The cythnigot is a foul fungal parasite that grows and thrives in the corpses of small creatures. It wears these bodies like a suit, but also adjusts and tailors the fleshy covering to suit its needs, and the body ends up looking as alien as anything else spawned from the Abyssal depths. The cythnigot's most identifying feature is the long stalk of fungal material that extends from creature's body, ending in a surprisingly strong set of fanged jaws.
The qlippoth presented here are but a small fraction of the squirming awfulness that lurks in the deeper rifts of the Abyss. Other types of qlippoth include multi-armed, crab-like gongorinans, which use living creatures as incubators; shapeshifting utukku, which infiltrate and undermine religions; death-spawned behimirons, which slay the living to reproduce; and the living siege engines known as catabolignes. Yet most frightening of all is the immense iathavos, a monster so abhorrent that even the Abyss cannot bear to allow more than one to exist at any one time.
Qlippoth ruled the Abyss for eons and still see themselves as its rightful rulers. When the Abyss first began to spawn demons from the souls of sinful humanoids, the realm was plunged into a brutal war spanning untold millennia, in which qlippoth, though more powerful and established, were slowly but surely driven back by the endless demonic hordes who spawned far more quickly than qlippoth could ever hope to match. Today, qlippoth have been driven to the deepest, darkest corners of the Abyss where they cling tightly to the crumbling remains of their territory.
As qlippoth lost territory to their demonic rivals, they realized that the only way to stem the tide of demonic forces was to starve them of the sinful souls that the Abyss uses to spawn new demons. While qlippoth have no concept of how they might go about preventing sin by changing the way mortals act, they do understand that exterminating mortal life would solve the problem as well.
The most powerful qlippoth are quasi-deities themselves, ancient entities only rarely worshipped by non-qlippoth. Of these monstrous divinities, the Polymorph Plague, Yamasoth, is the most well-known. Others include Chavazvug the Crawling Inferno, Isph-Aun-Vuln the Feaster Within, and Thuskchoon the Everglutton.
Although it is widely accepted that qlippoth have lost incalculable territory in the Abyss to demonkind, these fiends still control vast regions in the deepest reaches of that plane. Some sages suggest the troubling possibility that perhaps qlippoth still hold more territory of the Abyss than demons do, but because demons are more concerned with mortal life, we simply interact with the layers they control more often. For all we know, these dour sages postulate, the Abyss teems with endless swarms of qlippoth that have yet to make their move against mortal life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Daeodon.
Where the typical boar is merely ill-tempered and generally unfriendly, the towering daeodon is legitimately hateful and ruthlessly violent. Although omnivorous, the daeodon (known in some regions simply as a giant boar) prefers to feed on flesh. Primarily a scavenger, the daeodon isn’t adverse to attacking creatures it encounters while searching for easier meals, or to protect any perceived encroachment into its lair or feeding grounds. Particularly brave or skilled orcs are fond of using daeodons as mounts or war-trained battle beasts; orc cavalry mounted on daeodons is a fearsome force indeed.
A typical adult daeodon is 10 feet long and 7 feet tall at the shoulder. It weighs approximately 2,000 pounds.
Boars can be found in almost any environment, from forests to deserts, warm or cold, including even high-altitude mountainous regions. They tend to prefer forests, marshes, and meadows. Daeodons are likewise found in such regions but generally prefer remote reaches far from civilization.
A boar's carcass typically provides enough meat for 100 meals or more, as well as hide and bristles that can be used for crafting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dalos.
Dalos are reclusive fey that dwell within or near remote volcanoes and volcanic vents and resemble the massive calderas they call home. They more often dwell within the superheated confines of these locales than in the “cold wastelands” beyond their warmth and are therefore rarely encountered outside such environments. Like most fey, dalos are capricious and vengeful. They hate being disturbed above all else and will often warn away intruders with only the throw of a red-hot boulder before attacking outright.
A dalos stands 25 feet tall and weighs in excess of 20,000 pounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dandasuka.
Known as “biters” among the more powerful rakshasa castes, dandasukas serve as spies and assassins for rakshasa clans or powerful spellcasters who have found methods to bind one of these fiends to their will. Born to manipulate and murder, these half-sized terrors revel in their work and delight in the sight of blood. They often dress in extravagant clothes dyed with ostentatious colors and wear numerous elaborate accessories, whether in their true form or in disguise as human children, halfling merchants, or anything else that helps them blend into their targeted society.
A dandasuka rakshasa is constantly haunted by a monstrous hunger that gnaws at its hyperactive body, forcing it to feed often. In combat, a dandasuka might pause to lick a bloody blade or lap at a pool of spilled blood on the floor. These creatures settle for other meat when they must, but much prefer the taste of mortal humanoid flesh. Regular offers of such victuals can keep a dandasuka loyal to anyone willing to provide frequent meals, but care must be taken in keeping a dandasuka, for many stories tell of them being overly eager to serve an adored benefactor, taking off-hand remarks too literally, and performing services of violence that were never intended.
Above all rakshasas rule the rakshasa immortals, powerful unique entities who deem themselves deities. These beings include Aksha of the Second Breath, Bundha the Singing Butcher, Dradjit the Godslayer, Kunkarna the Dream Warrior, Mursha the Beastmaster, Otikaya the Spirit Archer, Surpa the Avenger, Zabha the Desecrator, and untold others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dark Naga.
Dark nagas are wicked, jealous creatures that crave power and wealth. Indeed, the dark naga sees such ideals as spiritual expressions of an essential truth: if one can take something, that something is theirs to have. The dark naga sees other creatures as lessers worthy only of subjugation or as rivals who must be eliminated.
Dark nagas dwell in remote places other creatures have forsaken, searching abandoned ruins for wealth and potent magic items. Those unlucky trespassers into a dark naga’s lair typically find themselves as the naga’s slaves or playthings, put to sleep with the monster’s poison or incinerated by its deadly magic. Some dark nagas are more disposed toward socializing than others; in these cases, they may become wicked despots who rule over enclaves of captive or unsuspecting subjects. Subtler dark nagas, especially those who crave finer luxuries, dwell in or under the wealthy settlements and use their wiles to garner a decadent following, forming something akin to a cult with the naga as the jewelry-bedecked object of worship.
Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society—an entire empire ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers with a patriotic pride that borders on worship.
Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins. In many cases, these nagas have heard of distant Nagajor, but they are usually unwilling to abandon their own pursuits to seek out a land where they might be worshipped as gods.
Dark nagas might rule over goblins, orcs, xulgaths, or decadent folk, especially corrupt aristocrats. Guardian nagas might be found with other goodly creatures of any sort, from fey in natural sites to constructs in ancient vaults.
Beyond the sinister dark naga and the benevolent guardian naga, many other types of nagas exist, including the mesmerizing spirit naga, the multiheaded royal naga, and the introspective and mysterious lunar naga.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Deadly Mantis.
These gigantic mantids make their homes within deep jungles and prehistoric forests where they hunt and devour equally massive prey.
Deadly mantises are sacrosanct to followers of Achaekek, the Mantis God. His adherents, including the infamous Red Mantis assassins, invite or lure deadly mantises close to their settlements, seeing the towering creatures as a sign of their god’s favor. Achaekek’s followers offer sacrifices of livestock or captured enemies to keep the massive insects well fed. Clerics of Achaekek defend a deadly mantis’s territory as if it were their own, believing it to be holy ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Deculi.
These batlike monstrosities inhabit the nooks and crevices of the Darklands, where they hang from stalactites and swoop down on unsuspecting prey. Though they are completely sightless, deculis possess rudimentary nerves in their skulls that allow them to detect the presence of infrared light—information they use to locate potential food and threats. They are deadly hunters, thanks largely to their magical ability to manipulate the ebb and flow of shadows. Deculis prefer to feed upon the warm blood of freshly killed prey, but they can subsist on carrion if they have to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Deep Gnome Rockwarden.
Deep gnome rockwardens follow druidic teachings and commune with the natural elemental influences and denizens of the Darklands. They know that not everything that lives below ground is sinister and evil, but they also understand that all primal spirits and entities must be respected.
The first deep gnomes rose in the underground world some time after their early gnome ancestors migrated from the First World to Golarion. A group of these migrants elected to settle underground instead of on the surface, and it was from these gnomes that the svirfneblin came to be. Some believe the gnomes chose the Darklands as their home to watch for and stop any evil fey who might infiltrate the underground region, but much like the exact reasons for the gnomes’ relocation, their motivation has been lost to time. Thousands of years of living in subterranean caverns with little to no light transformed the physical characteristics of the gnomes living there into those of the deep gnome of today.
Though deep gnomes may seem dour and recalcitrant at first glance, they retain the fey blood of their ancestors. In fact, deep gnomes are sometimes more emotionally erratic than their gnome cousins, lashing out violently at what seems like the smallest provocation. Such an explosion is often followed by an extended period of quiet brooding. Despite this, deep gnome communities are close-knit, as each citizen knows when to give the others the space they require to process their feelings.
Many deep gnome settlements have clashed with nearby duergar (pages 138–139) communities for myriad reasons: resources, territory, and even religion and morality. Over the centuries, some of these disputes have evolved into full wars, with many lives lost on both sides. Neither deep gnomes nor duergars are particularly proud of these conflicts, but both insist they were in the right each time. The ferocity with which most duergars fight has left a deep impression on the psyches of some deep gnome communities, leading them to distrust all dwarves and dwarf-like ancestries even more than other strangers. This can result in non-duergar dwarves being driven off from deep gnome cities before being able to explain themselves. A dwarf and even those traveling with a dwarf require patience and tenacity when attempting to deal with deep gnomes holding such views. Svirfneblins value crafting and many decorate their cavernous homes with paintings on the walls, often incorporating the rock in clever ways. They also value crystals and gems, making jewelry and beads that they string through their hair.
While most deep gnomes aren’t particularly religious, they respect the spirits of nature, especially those found within earth and stone. Most deep gnome druids, known as “rockwardens,” learn Terran, the language of the Plane of Earth, in order to speak with these forces, and some can even entreat with earth elementals. The handful of deep gnome communities of faith tend to worship neutral deities, such as Gozreh, Nethys, Pharasma, and the gnomish goddess Nivi Rhombodazzle. In such areas, a small church to the worshipped god is erected in the center of town and is open to the public around the clock, allowing the deep gnomes to worship as they see fit.
Most who dwell in the Darklands are sinister and cruel. While deep gnomes are not, those who seek their aid should remember that they don’t welcome strangers with open arms. In the brutal Darklands, such traits are seized upon by its denizens and treated as much as weaknesses as they are strengths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Deep Gnome Scout.
Deep gnome scouts patrol the tunnels that lead into their settlements. Some scout alone to make the most of their stealth, but others form groups for the sake of safety.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Deep Gnome Warrior.
Deep gnome warriors are quick to charge into battle but focus on defending their kin and their homes over more aggressive tactics when a choice is available.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Deghuun (Children Of Mhar).
Mhar, an ancient evil deity of caverns, mountains, and volcanoes, belongs to the pantheon of the Great Old Ones—monstrous beings of alien intellect and unfathomable power. The so-called children of Mhar (known as deghuuns in the chaotic tongues of Mhar's enraptured cultists) physically resemble blue-gray octopods made of stone, mud, and molten iron. Venthole-like craters dot the surface of a deghuun's body, through which the creature can gaze out with a single golden eye that it can move from crater to crater.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Deinonychus.
Deinonychuses are wily hunters that attack in groups of up to a dozen individuals, ripping apart their prey with sharp talons and powerful jaws. They are lean and muscular, and have two powerful legs and a long tail that helps them maintain balance. Although deinonychuses don’t use their dexterous clawed forelimbs to attack, the dinosaurs can use them to pull aside small barriers. Although some of these dinosaurs have scaly skin, most have thatches of vibrantly colored feathers as well. A deinonychus is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.
However, larger deinonychuses exist. These creatures—which stand taller than a human—are called megaraptors.
While the real world fossil records hold a wealth of inspiration for the reconstruction of dinosaurs in an RPG, you can also look to living creatures for ideas. Giving a dinosaur a poisonous bite or an unusual attack routine like Clobbering Charge ensures that dinosaurs are as interesting in combat as they are in appearance.
As with most animals, dinosaurs can be tamed or domesticated, but the difficulty of this task increases along with the dinosaur’s level. Lizardfolk and orcs are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, workhorses, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In certain cities, dinosaurs are popularly featured as combatants in blood sports and other gladiatorial battles.
As animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear. Dinosaurs can also be harvested for rare and valuable trophies such as teeth, talons, armor plates, and the like.
At first glance, the inclusion of dinosaurs in a fantasy setting might seem strange, but dinosaurs are an excellent creature to use in a game that bridges the gap between familiar real-world animals and legendary monsters. If having dinosaurs mix freely with lions, manticores, and dragons still seems strange to you, consider having them dwell in remote, primeval lands, as suggested in the sidebars on pages 99–100. On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in the wilder regions of the world, particularly on the continent of Garund, though they are common enough that PCs might find some on display in a menagerie in a northern city, in use as guardian creatures, or even kept by druids as loyal animal companions.
Another classic place that dinosaurs are found in fiction are in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal place to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day‑night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam.
In a fantasy setting, magical effects or supernatural influences can enhance dinosaurs by giving them unexpected attacks, modes of movement, or other abilities. You can quickly create a memorable magical beast simply by giving a dinosaur the magical attack of another creature of an equal level, such as a spinosaurus gaining an acidic breath weapon akin to that of an adult black dragon.
A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or a quick online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well. Armor-headed pachycephalosaurs, spike-thumbed iguanodons, duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed spinosauruses, and more await discovery by those who would seek out the mysteries of the lost worlds where the thunder lizards still rule!
Dinosaurs fit well into certain types of settings. They’re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Deinosuchus.
The deinosuchus is a primeval relative of the crocodile, and is an enormous predator capable of catching and eating dinosaurs that wander too close to its domain!
Crocodiles often live in warm, tropical areas, either in fresh or salt water. Alligators are found in more varied climates, but only in fresh water. Deinosuchuses, particularly the largest and most dangerous of their kind, prefer estuaries, bays, or other brackish bodies of water connected to both river and sea.
A crocodile’s skin can be used as leather, and its meat is chewy and mild, though even a large crocodile doesn’t usually yield more than 50 pounds of usable meat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Demilich.
Demiliches are formed when a lich, through carelessness or by accident, loses its phylactery. As years pass, the lich’s body crumbles to dust, leaving only the skull as the seat of its necromantic power. The lich enters a sort of torpor, its mind left wandering the planes in search of ever greater mysteries. The lich gradually loses the ability to cast spells and its magic items slowly subsume into its new form. Negative energy concentrates around the skull, causing some of its bones and teeth to petrify with power and turn into blight crystals. The resulting lich skull, embedded with arcane gemstones and suffused with palpably powerful magic, forms a creature called a demilich.
Despite its near-constant state of inactivity, a demilich grows restless from time to time, especially when living creatures draw near. Only then does the demilich’s hunger for life stir once more, causing it to lash out with terrifying bursts of power in attempts to consume vital energy. Unlike an ordinary lich, should the demilich’s skull be destroyed, its bond to the world is permanently severed, although some theorize that even then it is not truly slain. Rather, some think that once the demilich is destroyed, its foul and tormented mind is finally free to wander the planes and find new ways to enact its will. For the short-lived common folk of the Material Plane, this is good enough, though eons later a demilich may reappear in the region it once inhabited with a new—and even more insidious—agenda.
After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich’s servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich’s lair is a good indicator of the undead’s current mental state.
For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.
A lich can be any type of spellcaster, as long as it has the ability to perform a ritual of undeath as the primary caster (which can usually be performed only by a spellcaster capable of casting 6th-level spells). To create a lich, follow these steps.
Increase the spellcaster's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
Increase spell DCs and spell attack roll by 2.
A lich gains the undead trait and becomes evil. Liches lose all abilities that come from being a living creature.
A lich gains the following abilities.
Darkvision
Saving Throws +1 status bonus to all saves vs. positive
Negative Healing
Rejuvenation (arcane, necromancy) When a lich is destroyed, its soul immediately transfers to its phylactery. A lich can be permanently destroyed only if its phylactery is found and destroyed.
Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious
Resistances cold 20, physical 15 (except magic bludgeoning)
Frightful Presence (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 60 feet, DC 30
Hand of the Lich All liches have a hand unarmed attack that deals 1d8 negative damage for every 3 levels and inflicts a paralyzing touch. This attack has the finesse trait.
Drain Phylactery Frequency once per day; Effect The lich taps into its phylactery's power to cast any arcane spell up to the highest level the lich can cast, even if the spell being cast is not one of the lich's prepared spells. The lich's phylactery doesn't need to be present for the lich to use this ability.
Paralyzing Touch (arcane, curse, incapacitation, necromancy) A creature damaged by the lich's hand Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save against the lich's spell DC – 4. The creature becomes paralyzed for 1 round on a failure. On a critical failure, the creature is paralyzed permanently, falls prone, and seems dead. A DC 25 Medicine check reveals the victim is alive.
Although the abilities above are standard for a lich, you can create a more unusual lich by substituting any one of the following abilities for frightful presence, hand of the lich, Drain Phylactery, or paralyzing touch.
Blasphemous Utterances (arcane, aura, enchantment, mental) 10 feet. The lich is accompanied by a constant echo of blasphemous murmurs and tainted whispers. A creature in the aura takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against mental effects and can't take actions that have the concentrate trait unless they succeed at a DC 10 flat check. Failing this check wastes the action.
Cold Beyond Cold The lich's hand Strike deals cold damage instead of negative, and instead of being paralyzed, the target is slowed 2. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to slowed 1 (or negates it on a critical success).
Dark Deliverance The lich has resistance to positive equal to its level.
Siphon Life Trigger The lich deals damage with its hand Strike. Effect The lich regains Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt.
Void Shroud (aura, death, necromancy) 30 feet. The lich is surrounded by an aura of death, drawing forth souls to be consumed by the lich's constant hunger. Living creatures in the emanation take a –2 status penalty to saves against fear and death effects. In addition, any creature that starts its turn in the area gains the doomed 1 condition unless it succeeds at a Will save against the lich's spell DC – 4. Associated MonstersUndead minions are very common companions for a lich or demilich. Liches prefer mindless undead, that do what they’re told and don’t interrupt the lich’s studies with useless conversation. Liches with a knack for crafting are also fond of surrounding themselves with construct servitors and guardians, such as golems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Denizen of Leng.
Slavers and raiders from the cold, windswept dimension of Leng, these malevolent humanoids range across reality in ominous black ships capable of sailing beyond the borders of dimensions and planes. Although most denizens of Leng seek slaves and plunder like any pirate, others operate as self-styled ambassadors and merchants, sowing discord with far-ranging plots. While the inscrutable denizens dress themselves in flowing robes, veils, and broad turbans to appear human, their aberrant physiology, when glimpsed, is evident from their crown of stubby horns and tentacled jaws to their furry, goat-like legs.
Above the fierce captains who command the infamous black ships are an even higher caste of denizens of Leng. These cultists and musicians serve as high priests, laboring to appease the frightening gods who look down upon the Nightmare Realm with cold malice.
Known variously as the Nightmare Realm or the Terror Beyond Dreams, the frozen Plateau of Leng looms physically and spiritually above the Dreamlands. Both a part of that dimension and a corruption of it, Leng is a realm inhabited by eldritch horrors and ruled by the horrors' ancient gods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Derghodaemon (Ravager Daemon).
Derghodaemons represent death through unfathomable violence and being eaten alive. Whether in life a ravenous murderer hacked them to bits for stew, a werewolf tore them limb from limb, or they simply succumbed to the elements and became worm meat, derghodaemons seek to inflict the same twisted and bloody ends upon any they come across. Unlike some daemons, derghodaemons derive little pleasure from prolonged deaths—to these fiends, the quicker they can enact a gory demise, the sooner they can turn their attentions to their next victim and repeat the violent cycle.
Derghodaemons look like walking masses of razor-sharp insect claws connected to equally menacing chitinous limbs, but few linger on their appearance for long— the gaze of a derghodaemon is enough to cause others in the vicinity to experience severe visual warping. The derghodaemon's appearance becomes more and more twisted as those who stare at it experience vicious hallucinations and ravenous urges to inflict harm on and devour others. Perhaps the most horrific attack derghodaemons can unleash upon their victims, though, is their swarming infestation—the daemons cough up a crawling, buzzing cloud of ravenous insects that cling to those targeted and chew them to death, provided the mind-numbing, half-whispered threats made by the rasp of the insects' bodies don't drive them to violent fury first!
While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals’ fear.
While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane of pure evil for only the most corrupt souls. If Hell is a realm of torture and systematic depravity, Abaddon is its twisted cousin—a place where one can find only misery and despair in ample quantities, with neither the strictures of Hell nor the chaotic freedom of the Abyss. For evildoers who seek simply to inflict their wickedness on others, Abaddon is a rich hunting ground where one can revel in turpitude, though visitors be forewarned: the competition is fierce.
The four Horsemen are the most powerful of the daemonic demigods, but they are only four of many. Far more daemonic harbingers dwell on Abaddon, each a unique and powerful demigod in their own right that enjoys sweeping influence among daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector (ruler of the slave city of Awaiting Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian (consort to the Horseman of Famine), and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame (patron to arsonists and agent of the Horseman of War) are but three of the dozens of harbingers who rule realms in Abaddon.
Each of the four Horsemen is served by a specific category of servitor daemons known as deacons. Leukodaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Pestilence. Meladaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Famine, while thanadaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Death. Purrodaemons are currently the most powerful of the deacons, and serve the Horseman of War—yet over time, which category of deacon is the most powerful can wax and wane.
Numerous powerful and unique daemon demigods, known collectively as harbingers, rule over swaths of Abaddon. Above these demigods, though, are entities of even greater power—the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. As the eons go on, the names and identities of specific horsemen change. Currently, they consist of Apollyon (Horseman of Pestilence), Charon (Horseman of Death), Szuriel (Horseman of War), and Trelmarixian (Horseman of Famine). Of these, only Charon has never fallen to an upstart. Some hold that a “Fifth Horseman” once ruled over the other four, while others maintain that the eternally eclipsed sun in the skies above Abaddon is all that remains of this long-dead god.
As many daemons exist as there are awful ways to die. The bloody sangudaemon personifies death by blood loss, while the skeletal thanadaemon represents death from old age. The most powerful daemons are the olethrodaemons, who represent the massive deaths caused by apocalypses and the end of entire worlds.
Daemons often carry soul gems either as trophies or for powering an ability. Cacodaemons are the most common source for soul gems, but they can also be created by spells like bind soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem to power an ability, the trapped soul is released into the afterlife and can be resurrected normally.
Soul gems are traded in illicit markets, a tradition celestials and psychopomps alike find vile. Soul gems' value varies, but is generally worth an amount relative to the level of a gem's captive soul.
Daemons embody a fundamental paradox—while they are incarnations of death and seek to devour all that lives, they are themselves living creatures. Some speak of a glorious end time after which reality will finally be free of the contagion that is life itself. Most daemons give no thought to this paradox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dero Magister.
Dero magisters are leaders among dero society. They perform the bulk of the cruel operations and memory-altering procedures inflicted upon their victims.
Deros grow and ingest a poisonous fungus called cytillesh, also known as brain mold. Cytillesh gives off a pale blue glow and can cause birth defects and various adverse effects. Deros aren’t fazed by these detriments, as prolonged exposure can also slow the effects of aging and, in rare cases, provide occult powers to certain individuals known as “magisters.” Deros can also brew cytillesh spores into a poison that creates delusions and hallucinations.
Deros are fixated with curing their allergy to sunlight. To understand how the surface dwellers can withstand the light of the sun, deros conduct late-night raids on surface cities, abducting victims and performing terrible experiments on them. Those who survive are often returned with much of their memory erased and their bodies bearing mysterious scars. When these repressed memories surface, they lead to wild, hazy recollections of being abducted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Describe a Dero Strangler.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Desert Drake.
Distant cousins of blue dragons that lack their relatives’ magical talents and intelligence, these desert-dwelling drakes are nonetheless dangerous ambush predators, preying upon isolated desert travelers and outposts for food and supplies. They retain their true-blooded forebears’ resistance to electricity and affinity for sandy environs. Desert drakes’ scales range in coloration from rust-brown to light tan and ocher shades, mimicking the colors of the dunes they call home.
Desert drakes are among the lightest and most compact of the drakes, though this shouldn’t be mistaken for frailty. Their swooped-back horns and feather-thin wings are adapted to make burrowing as easy as possible. Indeed, a desert drake’s powerful neck makes wriggling through sand and other loose scree as easy as walking for it.
Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.
While drake hides aren’t any more valuable than those of other, similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. While they are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.
A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.
A drake egg has Hardness 3, 5 HP, and BT 5. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.
Once a drake hatches, it imprints on the first creature that it sees. A creature imprinted on in this way gains a +5 bonus to Nature checks to train or command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the region, the type of drake, and the exact purpose the buyer has in mind, but typically depends on the level of the drake. Because drakes are evil, dangerous, and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.
It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconfidence, or general lack of skill.
Drakes reach maturity and reproduce much earlier than dragons, meaning that they are a far more common threat than their more powerful forebears. Drakes have few qualms about dwelling with one another (provided they are the same species), often establishing dens in pockets of wilderness suitable to their needs, such as swampy grottoes, shallow shoreline caves, or cliffside perches.
The allure of hunting a dragon is difficult to resist for many adventurers, but accomplishing such a task is fraught with peril. Unscrupulous adventurers have been known to instead hunt drakes and use trophies harvested from these creatures to deceive locals.
While the different species of drakes are adapted to different climates and environments, many drakes share similar preferences regarding nest location, searching out high places that offer cover from above, such as cliffside or mountaintop caverns, jungle canopies, and so on.
While every adventurer knows that dragon hide can be crafted into potent armor or weapons, drake hide holds no such intrinsic value. Nonetheless, drake scales and horns are physically impressive, and to the uneducated buyer, might seem at first glance to be legitimate. Unscrupulous leatherworkers have been known to use drake hides to craft and sell counterfeit dragonhide armor, so potential buyers should remain on the lookout for scams.
Drakes share dragon’s interest in treasure, but lack dragons’ discerning taste. A drake hoard will certainly contain coins, jewelry, gemstones, gear, and even the odd magic item or two, but the bulk of the hoard invariably consists of broken weapons, shiny rocks, bits of junk, and other doubtful pieces of refuse.
Although drakes and dragons are related to one another, little love is lost between them, and even the most territorial drakes know better than to remain in a dragon's territory longer than they have to. In rare cases, large rampages of drakes band together to attack an encroaching dragon, especially if the dragon is young and inexperienced.
The drakes presented on these pages are far from the only types that exist. Forest drakes have green hides, spit acidic clouds, and can be found in temperate woodlands. Rift drakes, among the most powerful of their kind, spit clinging caustic vapors and dwell in badlands and regions scarred by devastating magical disasters. Sea drakes can be found in oceans across the world, lava drakes in volcanic crevasses, mist drakes along coastlines and in salt marshes, and spire drakes in ragged, rocky hills. Undoubtedly, many other types of drakes lurk in the far corners of the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Destrachan.
This underground reptilian horror walks on two powerful hind legs. Its forelimbs are armed with sharp curving claws, and its toothy, eyeless, tubular head has three hypersensitive frilled ears that turn toward any sound made in its vicinity. This cruel monster's true weapon, however, is an amplified version of the sonic cry that it uses to navigate, communicate, and hunt. It communicates with others of its kind through a complex series of clicks, shrieks, and whistles, but it is intelligent enough to understand other languages. Most destrachans understand at least one other language—usually Undercommon—and can often be reasoned with.
An obligate carnivore, the destrachan relishes fresh meat but won't hesitate to make a meal of carrion it finds in its path. When traveling in packs, the creatures take great delight in stalking travelers through miles of tunnels before attacking and subduing them, then devouring them alive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Devourer.
When fiends and powerful evil spellcasters are lost beyond the farthest reaches of the multiverse, they sometimes return as horrific undead called devourers that consume the souls of the living to fuel their arcane machinations. Their bodies are ruined and rebuilt, hollow and twisted, even as their minds undergo a spiritual transformation. They gain the ability to bind other souls to their own and drain their essence for magical power, yet can never be sated in their pursuit of it. Seething masses of distorted ghostly shapes surge within their hollow rib cages—manifestations of the devourers' most recently consumed souls.
The fact that devourers consume souls makes them particularly hated by the church of Pharasma and psychopomps alike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dezullon.
Dezullons are dangerous carnivorous pitcher plants that dwell in forested regions with thick canopies. They hunt for meat along the forest’s understory when not sunning themselves in the boughs above. Dezullons are smart enough to notice that some creatures are attracted by shiny things, and sometimes use such objects to set up ambushes. To assume that the dezullon’s ambulations are slow simply because the creature has a root structure is a foolish mistake; many an adventurer has been crushed to death by this surprisingly agile plant. In addition, these dangerous plants are expert climbers, making their pursuit even more difficult to escape from.
A hungry dezullon keeps prey off-balance by spilling its putrid, psychoactive digestive juices from its central pitcher. In addition to being highly acidic, the enzymes in a dezullon’s digestive tract, once expelled, inflict a victim with powerful hallucinations and amnesia. This secondary effect makes dezullons highly sought after in some circles, including avid drug users, experimental doctors, and criminals who deal in poisons.
Many varieties of dezullon exist, including lumbering giants of incredible size, those that have tiny, cup-shaped pitchers that proliferate along lengths of creeping ivy like suckers on a squid’s tentacles, and others with hundreds of blood-red, razor-sharp leaves that protrude from the inside of their pitchers like a leech’s teeth. This latter variety is especially dangerous, since the leaves can all but eviscerate creatures that become ensconced inside their pitchers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dhampir Wizard.
This dhampir is a svetocher, the child of a moroi vampire.
Many dhampirs lived their childhoods as orphans, often because their mortal parents believed their child to be cursed and abandoned them, or perished as a result of a difficult childbirth. Often outcast, some dhampirs leverage their charisma and personal magnetism to manipulate those around them, while others struggle to form relationships. Frequent mistrust of a dhampir’s parentage present further challenges when dhampirs attempt to integrate into mortal society. Those who seek out their vampiric parent instead often find themselves considered inferior, rejected as they were with regular mortals but for different reasons. But in regions like Nidal, Geb, and Ustalav, where vampires themselves carry some degree of respect, dhampirs can sometimes find their heritage empowering.
Dhampirs fill countless roles within many communities. Some prefer to blend in as best they can, holding regular jobs and building families (most children born to dhampirs share an ancestry with the dhampir’s mortal parent, but a rare few are born as dhampirs themselves). Those who learn to make the most of their inherited charm can achieve a high societal status, whether leveraging traditional avenues of power or gathering followers enamored by the dhampir’s abilities. With a lifespan rivaling that of an elf, a dhampir can develop extensive influence and engage in long-reaching schemes of massive scope. Further, their ancestry lends them a proclivity to necromancy and the occult arts.
Most dhampirs make their homes in urban areas, though some more reclusive individuals claim ruins or dungeons as their domains.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dig-Widget.
Thieves covet dig-widgets, specialized constructs built for infiltration. Each dig-widget contains numerous simple tools, including a set of mechanical devices that function as thieves' tools, two arms with drills, and two arms with corkscrews for attaching to and climbing surfaces. Once activated, these devices propel themselves forward. Though they have the full faculties typical of a construct, they usually follow a simple routine: avoid notice, pick any lock barring the path, dig past obstacles, and attack if caught. They're rarely left unattended, as a thief needs to be nearby to follow after-both to steal goods and to stop the dig-widget from engaging in further larceny once it's achieved its goal.
The source of a dig-widget's power is as much mechanical as it is magical. The gears and springs that provide a dig-widget mobility are an improvement over more primitive true clockwork creations (whose functions require constant winding to remain mobile), but at the cost of security, for a dig-widget's moving parts can be dismantled quickly by thieves and others with the proper training.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dire Wolf.
Much larger and more foul-tempered than their common cousins, dire wolves haunt primeval lands that accommodate their massive size and proportionately large hunting grounds and appetites. Orcs are fond of using dire wolves as mounts, finding their vicious tempers perfect for hunting and warfare.
Wolf packs claim and defend large swaths of territory, which they regularly patrol in search of both prey and competitors. It takes a pack roughly 10 days to cover the entire breadth of its territory, which can stretch for miles in any direction but usually adheres to natural terrain. Wolves keep claim over their territories by marking trees with their scent and howling to keep other packs away. If these warnings prove insufficient to drive off potential competitors, the pack attacks the intruders directly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Djinni.
Benevolent genies from the Plane of Air, djinn value art, culture, knowledge, and trade. They also love new experiences, succulent dishes, and heady wines. Of all geniekind, they are most likely to approach humans and other mortals, interacting with them on friendly terms. Still, djinn are proud of their genie heritage and have a tendency to be patronizing toward mortals, a habit that has earned them a reputation for arrogance.
Djinn get along with jann and marids, but they find shaitans too stiff and harbor undying hatred for efreet. Although djinn are formidable combatants, they despise war and prefer to eschew violence in favor of dealing with their opponents using magic or subterfuge (making an exception, of course, when they encounter efreet).
Genie nobles with titles unique to their kind (as detailed in each sidebar) rule genie society. Genie nobles are generally at least 5 levels higher than a typical example of their kind. In addition to the increased statistics afforded by their higher levels, genie nobles gain additional spells. But the most wondrous (and notorious) of a genie noble’s powers is their ability to grant wishes. Any genie noble (save for jann, who lack this power) can grant a mortal or undead creature up to three wishes within a year’s time. Many unscrupulous creatures compel genie nobles to serve them, tricking them or entrapping them with magic. However, once a genie noble grants a third wish to a single creature, they are freed from service to that creature forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Doblagub (Elder Brughadatch).
Elder brughadatches command groups of fellow brughadatches, who placate the doblagub with fresh meals and trophies of the group’s grisly catches.
Brughadatches of all life stages tend to cohabitate, since their abilities naturally synergize and tip the odds of survival in their favor. A single brughadatch elder—known as a doblagub—leads a clan, while midlife brughadatches serve as scouts, hunters, and laborers. Gahlepods dwell in large, stagnant ponds and bogs around the brughadatches’ holdings, so they are often the first to interact with creatures that carelessly wander into their domain. Adventurers who make it past these bogs often fail to realize the connection between the gahlepods and the amphibious tricksters further on in the swamp until they encounter the doblagub, who is now roused and commands their brethren in battle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Doorwarden.
Doorwardens are constructs originally invented by elves. Upon first glance, these guardians resemble ornate doors made entirely of steel or even mithral, but when trespassers try to force their way past, the doorwarden transforms into a skilled and sturdy soldier bearing its “door” like a towering shield.
Perceptive travelers can sometimes spot a door warden before its magic becomes obvious. The door often bears a round disk or similar embossment that resembles a shield boss designed for bashing, and the bar that can be lowered to block entry resembles an arm clasping a longsword by the hilt. The original doorwardens crafted by the elves included a motif of elven armor and a metal mask in the style of Alseta’s own, though other cultures embellish their own doorwardens with their own themes and sometimes even their own ancestral weapons, such as axes for dwarven doorwardens.
Doorwardens sometimes know about the chambers they guard, and they have been known to speak to trespassers, especially elves. But a doorwarden cannot be persuaded to stand aside; it is bound to the portal where it has been placed and will defend it until destroyed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Doppelganger.
In their natural forms, doppelgangers are humanoid creatures with flesh of indeterminate color and features that lack fine details, as if unfinished. As masters of mimicry, they use their abilities to impersonate others in devious ways, often infiltrating settlements and residing within them for years without being detected.
Doppelgangers are incredibly secretive, with some nearing outright paranoia. They choose their targets carefully and go to great lengths not to reveal their intentions before their plans come to fruition. Doppelgangers usually infiltrate communities in order to gain some manner of wealth or power, and assume the guises of other (usually influential) persons to allow the creatures they’re impersonating to take the fall for any negative consequences that may result from their actions.
Though most are not evil, doppelgangers are manipulative and self-serving. As they don’t have their own society and aren’t monolithic in their motivations, an individual doppelganger has its own unique interests and impulses, though many are over-indulgent. Some doppelgangers enjoy the thrill of subtlety, while others favor grander schemes, such as manipulating a nation’s political infrastructure. Others seek to exploit merchant guilds to gain immense wealth, while others use their shape-changing ability to destroy relationships between close friends or families.
Doppelgangers are careful and patient creatures. They are willing to slowly construct elaborate schemes that may require extended periods of time—even decades—to yield results.
Doppelgangers often work alone, as they don’t trust potential cohorts not to ruin their plans. There are rare times when doppelgangers might reveal secrets to high-ranking individuals to ensure a successful infiltration. When they do work with others, it’s because they’ve taken the shape of a target group’s leader, unbeknownst to the organization’s members.
Doppelgangers can grow in power by learning skills and abilities, and often make excellent rogues, spellcasters, or fighters. A doppelganger that has class abilities can often effectively infiltrate and plague an adventuring group as a powerful antagonist—but using a doppelganger like this in your game should be handled with care (see the Infiltrating a Party sidebar above for more information).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Doprillu.
The aberrations known as doprillus are hulks with banded muscles who wear ornate masks at all times that fill their wearers with magical strength and fighting spirit. Doprillus love to battle, especially by grappling, and are eager to start brawls. On neutral ground, a doprillu offers to duel the strongest-looking opponent, but when a doprillu's home turf is invaded, no rules apply to the confrontation. As befits the superheated blood that fuels them, doprillus make their homes in warm locations: hot jungles, sunny deserts, and underground caverns near sulfur vents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dracolisk.
Dracolisks are rare magical crossbreeds of chromatic dragons and basilisks. None now know how they first came to be, but they have proven viable and can breed with one another as well as with basilisks. While a dracolisk appears much like a young true dragon of its parent type, its eight legs are an immediate indication that it is something more. Its coloration varies, depending on the nature of its draconic ancestry, though it's lighter on its underside and darker near its wing tips. A typical dracolisk is 15 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dragonscarred Dead.
Not all would-be dragonslayers who die a valiant death rest peacefully amid the annals of legend. Sometimes, a draconic necromancer is so impressed by its fallen foe that the dragon ritually raises the dead warrior to serve the dragon in undeath. These undead guardians are infused with a fraction of the power of the dragon who slew them, channeling the same energy as their draconic masters’ breath.
Dragonscarred dead are similar to skeletal champions or graveknights in that they are not merely reanimated servants who mindlessly follow orders, but are instead powerful wardens who maintain the same agency they bore in life. While a dragonscarred dead is often magically compelled to follow its reanimator’s commands, some of these undead dragonslayers manage to escape their masters and pursue their own vile agendas—which may involve rallying allies to challenge their draconic creator once more and finish the dire mission they started in life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dragonshard Guardian.
Created by Mengkare and powered by a shard of the Orb of Gold Dragonkind, this construct is made of sculpted crystal draped in a beautiful gold filigree frame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dragon Turtle.
When sailors warn others of the terrible threats of the open sea, they seldom forget to mention dragon turtles—immense aquatic dragons with rocky shells similar to those of tortoises and flippers powerful enough to overturn hardy vessels. These fearsome creatures enjoy being considered as dangerous as storms or natural disasters by seafaring folk. Dragon turtles delight in amassing treasure, although most prefer to receive tribute from passing sailors and often store their hoards in the shipwrecks of vessels once crewed by those unwilling to surrender their valuables. Dragon turtles are solitary creatures and hunt in regions encompassing a hundred square miles or more. Although they normally eat large fish, they are omnivorous and also eat seaweed or even foolhardy dragon hunters. Experienced sailors keep a keen eye out for dragon turtles, preparing to flee should one approach or offer it treasure in exchange for safe passage.
Most dragon turtles are at least 20 feet wide and 50 feet long, although some can grow substantially larger. These massive, ancient dragon turtles are somnolent, and resemble rocky islands from a distance; their prodigious hoards can be a source of truly ancient sea lore. Legends persist of truly immense dragon turtles who spend centuries drifting on the surface of the ocean, far from established shipping lanes or charted waters, with shells that serve as islands capable of supporting entire ecosystems and even, some claim, small settlements whose inhabitants know nothing of land that doesn’t drift across the sea.
Dragon turtles keep their treasure in shipwrecks at the bottom of the ocean. Their hoards usually contain coins, jewelry, and magic items that can survive lengthy submersion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Drainberry Bush.
Drainberry bushes are floating bushes that originate from the First World, with long, thorny vines and dense clusters of bright-red berries. Their hollow thorns quickly siphon blood, which is how these carnivorous plants feed, and they rapidly turn consumed blood into fresh batches of delicious berries. Drainberry bushes exude a faint white glow that is a result of stored positive energy.
Drainberry bushes exhibit unusually high intelligence and have an astute sense of value. They typically become insulted when creatures attempt to harvest their berries. Creatures that attempt to converse with drainberry bushes finds the plants telepathically convey only short and simple phrases: most commonly, “Money please,” “Deal good,” “Deal no good,” “Want that,” (with a gesture toward an item it covets), “Thank you, customer,” and if necessary, “No refunds.” Though a drainberry bush considers the market value of its berries to be 25 gp, it greatly prefers interesting art objects as payment—even ones of significantly lower value.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Drakauthix.
The drakauthix is a massive fungus that floats through the heights of the largest Darklands caverns, propelled by bladders that spray air and spores. A voracious but slow-moving hunter, the drakauthix prefers to ambush meaty creatures from above, using its hooked appendages to pull its victims upward to feed. The drakauthix’s digestive process is entirely external—it clings to victims, and its spore-laden surface slowly feeds on and grows through the flesh before the spore-infested carcass is discarded. As the infested body strikes the ground below, it bursts and releases a cloud of spores, unleashing a host of young called sporelings that immediately scuttle up the cavern walls to cling to its ceiling and grow.
The drakauthix behaves no more intelligently than most predatory animals, and often uses a sort of symbiotic scavenger method to secure prey by capitalizing on the hunting methods of oozes and vermin found in the large cave systems it frequents. When a relatively mindless creature kills a victim, the drakauthix drifts down, hooks the freshly slain carcass with its tendrils, and reels in its meal. The mindless ooze or other creature that just had its food stolen rarely holds a grudge and simply slithers off to find a new quarry, letting the drakauthix digest the corpse in peace. Of course, the drakauthix isn’t above feasting on more active prey as well, and might attack an adventurer who neglects to look upward for danger when exploring a network of mysterious caves.
Some Darklands-dwelling creatures, such as duergars, hunt drakauthixes for their flesh, which has a unique flavor with a peppery aftertaste. Subterranean races also make ink from drakauthixes by burning their carcasses, then grinding and pressing the ashes for a long time until a silvery substance congeals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Draugr.
Risen corpses of sailors who died at sea, draugr reek of the rot and decay of the briny deep. Their eyes glow with ghastly green light, and rotting seaweed, barnacles, and dead sea creatures cling to their bodies. Draugr can't speak, but expresses their malicious emotions with gurgles, as though they were eternally drowning with lungs full of water. They desire little more than to attack living creatures, especially those who sail the sea. Even when they go upon land, draugrs often drag the corpses of those they strike down back to the water, populating the depths with even more dead.
Draugr rise in the haunted places of the sea, where restless spirits, swells of negative energy, or supernatural storms deliver death. A corpse might rest at the bottom of the sea for some time before awakening as a draugr. Collecting detritus and organisms, a corpse becomes increasingly disgusting before it finally rises. Proximity to intelligent life can expedite this process, and an underwater explorer who happens upon a shipwreck might cause a body to snap to unlife as a draugr suddenly. The creatures don't take intrusions lightly, especially upon their place of death.
Though steeped in evil, draugr are susceptible to reminders of their lives as mariners. In particular, a well-performed sea shanty or call-and-response work song might cause a draugr to become lost in reverie for a moment. The creatures have even been witnessed moaning along, unable to sing the words but providing haunting accompaniment. The lull rarely lasts long, though, as the beauty of the song quickly becomes a reminder of the tragedy that befell the draugr, reaffirming their desire for blood and death.
More powerful draugr with burning red eyes are called draugr captains. They're 3rd-level creatures with elite adjustments that can cast obscuring mist as an innate divine spell three times per day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dreadsong Dancer.
Dreadsong dancers are shaped from the souls of bards, dancers, and musicians who pledged themselves to Hell in exchange for enhanced artistic ability. Fiendish flesh-sculptors twist these forfeited souls so they cannot perform the art that drove them in life—sewing their mouths shut, mutilating their limbs, and grafting serrated scythe-like appendages called songblades. Devils send these warped creatures to torment artists who seem likely to break their infernal contracts, both to mete out punishment and, perversely, to give mortals a glimpse of the fate that awaits their damned souls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dread Wraith.
These menacing spiritual remnants of wicked warlords or bloodthirsty generals are towering specters of shadow and death. Like other wraiths, dread wraiths haunt the shadowy places of the world, but dread wraiths are more likely to travel greater distances to sow terror or amass influence, often sticking to dark glades or sinister ruins when journeying across sun-dappled lands. Dread wraiths tends to be arrogant and rarely form a pack with others of their kind, preferring instead to dominate groups of ordinary wraiths. A particularly powerful necromancer might compel packs of dread wraiths into service, however, while a particularly malevolent goal—such as to eradicate a bastion of light and life—might draw several dread wraiths together in a common purpose.
Wraiths weigh nothing and are unharmed by most physical attacks. They haunt any place where they can feed on the living, though their vulnerability to sunlight confines them to the shadowy places of the world—places where they can blend in seamlessly with their dark surroundings before silently engulfing their prey.
Wraiths may form packs with others of their kind in places where death and mayhem are commonplace—countrysides ravaged by war, metropolitan underworlds run by criminal overlords, or sites of fiendish cultic rituals. In these places, the living do well to tread with sunrods and powerful clerics in tow. Ruins, sewers, and abandoned buildings provide sanctuary for wraiths during the day, as the creatures hunt exclusively at night or in dark places. Wraiths are smart enough to take advantage of their incorporeality in combat, so they keep to tortuous caverns or structures with hallways and avoid open areas.
As they're formed purely of anti-life from the Negative Energy Plane, wraiths pervade that unholy realm. Within nations and civilizations ruled by the undead, wraiths have places of power as assassins and spies. They're among the ruling class in Geb, but have greater numbers in Ustalav, where packs of wraiths roam graveyards and misty trails, consuming the populations of entire villages. In other parts of the world, wraiths tend not to wander and limit their activity to smaller environs, typically just the site of their chosen haunting and its immediate surroundings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dream Spider.
A dream spider's webs have an iridescent hue and are infused with the same hallucinogenic compound as the creature's toxin. Originally denizens of tropical jungles, dream spiders have adapted well to temperate environments, particularly thriving among the rooftops of cities where shady alchemists use their venom to produce the drug known as shiver.
Though they are vermin incapable of forming true alliances, spiders show up alongside many types of creatures, including web lurkers. Spellcasters sometimes call upon spiders using summon animal, and spider swarms have a way of popping up just about anywhere at the most inopportune times.
A staggering number of species of giant spider exist in the world. Some, like the dream spider, whose venom creates strange hallucinations, are relatively small. Others, like the lumbering ogre spider, are larger than horses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Drider.
The first fleshwarping process mastered by the drow remains both their most successful and most infamous: the drider. Fusing the body of a drow with that of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic fleshwarp—the only fleshwarp known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reflection on the matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.
Although the fleshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment for drow who fell from grace, the significant powers and strengths gained from the horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure. In return for mandatory time (typically measured in decades) serving as a guardian, soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city’s periphery. The painful truth is that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow have a penchant for working their fleshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility.
Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic. A drider’s innate spells remain the same regardless of the magical tradition, but those who use different types of magic as prepared spells may well have entirely different spells prepared than the drider presented below.
Not every fleshwarp emerges from its vat capable of survival. Many perish within minutes, as organs fundamental for life simply fail or collapse in on themselves. Fleshwarpers can usually recycle failed fleshwarps back into the mix quickly enough, but now and then, remnants known as fleshdregs are stable enough to live pain-wracked lives of their own. These foul creatures often infest fleshwarper holdings, like rats or other vermin do in less awful locations.
Grothluts may be the weakest example of a fleshwarp, and driders the most successful, but others exist as well. Ghonhatines are lumbering fleshwarps formed from xulgaths, while the tentacled irnakurses are formed from surface-dwelling elves. Sinspawn are fleshwarps as well, of course, although their methods of creation differ drastically from the techniques mastered by drow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Drow Fighter.
Drow fighters train to master techniques that inflict deep, bleeding wounds and use poisoned crossbow bolts to exhaust enemies.
Over the centuries to follow, the drow developed into a powerful, if violently dysfunctional society, influenced by the worship of demon lords and focused on providing power and glory to a relatively small collection of noble houses. Many of these noble houses are matriarchal in nature and all hold allegiance to a specific demon lord patron—but traditions of worship, warfare, and wizardry help to bind the oft-bickering houses together enough that drow society doesn’t simply consume itself from within. Fear of earning the wrath of one’s superior—be it a teacher, a parent, a commander, or the demon one worships—is the real bond holding drow society together, and this system is held in esteem by the lowliest drow servant and by the most powerful drow priestess alike.
The drow are infamous throughout the world, but until recently most assumed stories of demon-worshipping, underground-dwelling elves were spooky legends crafted to share around a campfire. Today, the existence of drow is an understood truth, and while their presence in the dark caverns deep below is unsettling, they seem content to leave the surface world alone for now.
Rarely, when a surface elf commits an act of cruelty heinous enough to draw the attention of a demon lord, transformation into a drow can happen spontaneously—but these transformations are rare enough to be legends in their own right. No known instance of a drow reverting to an elf has ever been recorded.
While drow society is evil, not all drow are bound to these norms. Those who seek something better in life are invariably exiles and often flee to the surface to escape their sinister kin. These drow often live as hermits, or they seek out societies where others have yet to hear the legends regarding their kind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Drow Priestess.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Drow Rogue.
Loners at heart, drow rogues trust no one—least of all fellow slayers. These drow rely on awareness and adaptation to survive the cutthroat nature of their society.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Dryad.
Dryads are fey guardians of the trees and creatures who dwell in wooded areas. They prefer using indirect methods to dissuade those who would harm their sacred groves and beloved forests, but they are not above using enchantments to enlist the aid of allies when evil threats cannot be dissuaded with words alone. In times of peace, dryads happily live secluded lives inside their trees, and a community at harmony with nature might not even realize a dryad lives nearby.
Though they watch over all the woods around them, dryads are inextricably tied to a specific tree, usually an oak. Dryads who are bonded to another type of tree are fundamentally the same, but they may differ in temperament and appearance to match their ward. For instance, kraneiai, or cherry-tree dryads, have beautiful pink coloration and concern themselves with the fragile beauty of life.
Nymph queens are powerful nymphs that rule over entire regions of untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds. Every variety of nymph can have a queen. Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad queens as simply “nymphs.”
A nymph queen is 6 to 10 levels higher than an ordinary nymph of the same type, with enhanced numerical statistics and improved Strikes to match. A nymph queen’s ward is a significant region, and she strengthens and vivifies this territory with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the corresponding ability (such as a dryad’s tree dependent ability); instead, they gain the tied to the land ability, as described below. A nymph queen also gains the nymph’s beauty aura and the Focus Beauty action, which have varying effects based on the queen’s original type. She gains the Inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the Change Shape ability to change her form. Finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a druid of her level.
Change Shape (polymorph, primal, transmutation) Nymph queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking version of their natural form.
Focus Beauty (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal, visual) The nymph queen focuses her beauty upon a target within her aura. The creature must attempt a Will save. On a failure, it is affected as if by the nymph queen’s nymph’s beauty aura; if it was already affected by the aura, it suffers a greater effect described in the nymph queen’s entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn.
Inspiration (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) A nymph queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with the nymph queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves.
If a nymph queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and the nymph queen is that bard’s muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.
Nymph’s Beauty (aura, emotion, enchantment, mental, primal, visual) 30 feet. Creatures that start their turn in the aura must succeed at a Will save or suffer an effect described in the nymph queen’s entry.
Tied to the Land A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region, such as a forest for a dryad queen. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals such as blight that would harm the environment, using her Spell DC with a counteract level equal to the highest-level druid spell she can cast. When the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region.
Nymphs are living manifestations of beauty and grace, and as such they are often the subjects of art—sculpture and paintings in particular. Promising a nymph to immortalize them in a work of art can be an excellent way to secure that nymph’s favor, but one should take care to ensure that the nymph admires and is proud of the artistic effort’s final result, lest the nymph be insulted and lash out with her powerful magic.
Nymphs tend to be closely associated with specific areas of natural splendor and beauty—woodlands for dryads, rivers for naiads. Areas where nymphs dwell always look more pristine, breathtaking, and scenic than they would otherwise.
Nymphs sometimes carry magical trinkets or wear enchanted clothing or jewelry, but the greatest treasure a nymph queen can share is often her inspiration to those seeking a muse.
Naiads and dryads are the most well-known nymphs, but others exist as well. Hesperides, for example, are wards of the sunset and golden light and can be encountered dwelling on coastal cliffsides or remote islands. Lampads, on the other hand, are dark, moody nymphs found in wondrous, crystal-lined caverns deep underground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dryad Queen (Hamadryad).
Hamadryads rule over an entire forest, or a portion of an incredibly large forest, leading and protecting all dryads within. Hamadryads often have strange relationships with powerful and deadly fey, working together in a dualistic way despite their differences, with the hamadryad representing nature’s wonders and the other fey representing nature’s wrath.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Duergar Bombardier.
Alchemy intrigues many duergars, and their cruel traditions often motivate them to experiment on slaves. Eager to inflict pain and justify the abuse as a method of expanding knowledge, duergar bombardiers often accompany slaver bands so they can have the first chance to select their next test subjects from captured victims. To duergar bombardiers, the lob of each bomb represents a new opportunity to observe how their targets react and record the results to enhance future modifications to their alchemical concoctions.
Duergars are gray-skinned creatures, often referred to as “ashen” by those surface dwarves willing to speak of them. These subterranean dwarves have a strong natural connection with cave-dwelling vermin, and it’s common to see duergar caravans drawn by teams of immense beetles. Most duergars devote themselves to the worship of Droskar, a taskmaster of a god who demands back-breaking toil in addition to regular prayer. Duergar leadership often consists of powerful divine servants of Droskar, along with incredibly stout warriors whose martial prowess ensures they can overcome any direct threat to their rule. Almost every aspect of duergar society is controlled by a strict hierarchy of leadership, with taskmasters directing subordinates across all walks of life.
Duergar communities are found deep underground in the ruins of abandoned dwarven cities. Generations of duergar occupation have resulted in the loss of dwarven history as the ashen honor their taskmaster deity by reworking traditional dwarven art into topics that elevate the exiled god. That duergars themselves seem incapable of achieving the heights of artistry mastered by their dwarven ancestors is both a source of frustration and shame that only fosters greater resentment of those who dwell on the surface.
Unlike classical dwarven practitioners of magic, duergars have embraced the practice of occultism. All duergars have at least a few innate occult spells, primary among them being the ability to magically increase their size. This power not only aids them in intimidating and bullying their slaves, but also serves as a potent combat option against their many enemies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Duergar Sharpshooter.
Duergar sharpshooters serve both as ranged support for slaver parties and as snipers posted on towers overlooking quarries and other areas where enslaved workers toil away the hours. Duergar sharpshooters also specialize in nonlethal methods of ranged combat—tactics they are often called upon to use when quelling slave riots or capturing escaped slaves.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Duergar Taskmaster.
Duergar priests of the taskmaster god Droskar often assume leadership roles within their communities, advancing the goals of their deity through coercion and displays of force. Often referred to as duergar taskmasters, these leaders often issue commands to duergar subordinates and slaves in the same breath, treating the two almost as if they were interchangeable. As a result, duergar taskmasters are loathed by both slave and slaver alike.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Dullahan.
Riding on a horse as black as night, the headless hunter known as the dullahan tracks down and takes the heads of those it deems unfit to continue living. When closing in for the kill, the dullahan first whispers its victim’s name, then swiftly collects its prize, casting a pall of dread upon all who witness the grim execution.
A dullahan manifests when a particularly violent warrior is beheaded and the warrior’s soul stubbornly clings to material existence (or is refused entry to the afterlife). Most dullahans return to their former homelands, where they can exact vengeance those they feel wronged them in life (or their living descendants). A dullahan’s concept of justice is swift and merciless, and once it has selected a target, it is unwavering in its cause.
Perhaps even more than revenge on the living, a dullahan desires its own rotted head. An individual who wields the head of a dullahan is powerful indeed, for a dullahan will grudgingly serve such a master in the hopes of reclaiming its missing skull. Mighty fiends such as devils command dullahans to harvest souls or lead armies for them, while a mortal might use such an undead warrior to fulfill a personal vendetta. No matter its master’s rank or station, however, a dullahan won’t hesitate to kill its liege and reclaim its head when the opportunity presents itself.
Most dullahan lairs are abandoned, overgrown ruins or other dilapidated places where severed heads and other trophies line the walls. Some dullahans, on the other hand, are content to simply commit their foul deeds and leave the remains of their decapitated victims in the streets, strewn among a copse of dead trees, or unceremoniously tossed in a bog hole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Duneshaker Solifugid.
The largest solifugids, duneshakers, are so immense that their movements make the terrain around them tremble. They can prey on creatures the size of mammoths or even larger.
Most species of solifugid lay their eggs in burrows. The female doesn’t eat while guarding her eggs, and thus fights even more aggressively against any creatures she deems potential threats to her brood. The bodies of wayward adventurers often litter such burrows, though the risks of exploring such treasure-laden nests often deter fortune-hunters from trying their luck with such caches.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Duskwalker.
Duskwalkers are infused with the same energies as psychopomps. These ashen scions are reborn on the Material Plane to serve as guardians of the cycle of life and death.
An important distinction exists between planar scions and extraplanar humanoids, such as fetchlings. Fetchlings and other extraplanar humanoids represent true ancestral groups with their own physical and cultural identities and traditions. Planar scions are members of diverse ancestries who share a similar inheritance from extraplanar beings and, with exception of marids, typically integrate into other humanoid societies instead of building their own.
As many types of planar scions exist as planes of existence, and even then there are significant differences between scions depending on the exact nature of their extraplanar forebears. Angelic scions are known as aasimars, fiendish scions are called tieflings, and monitor scions are urobians.
Two other planar scions are the entropy-infused ganzi and their polar opposites, the orderly aphorites, scions of chaos and law respectively.
Most planar scions are the distant descendants of some immortal progenitor far back in the family’s bloodline. Others, however, may be the result of powerful planar energies, magical curses, or even the intervention of a deity or demigod.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dust Mephit.
Whining and self-important creatures, dust mephits are known for their tendency to pronounce doom and gloom at every opportunity, lamenting every insignificant and minor difficulty as though it were an insurmountable obstacle and making themselves out to be heroes for struggling valiantly against their cruel fates. They tend to be thin and gaunt, with dusky brown and gray skin and wings.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Mephits are a favorite target for low-level spellcasters to summon, both because they have several useful abilities and because they are relatively easy to command and manipulate. Still, care must be taken when using mephits as minions, because if left unwatched or unattended for too long, they can cause all sorts of mischief.
Different types of mephits that can be found on the same elemental plane often develop friendly (or, in some cases, fierce) rivalries with one another. While mephits from elementally opposed planes (such as fire and water) may have strong opinions about the superiority of their own element, the fact that they rarely see such mephits means that when they do encounter them, they often get along better than they do with their close neighbors.
Perhaps because they're so often compelled into service by mortal conjurers and more powerful elementals, mephits tend to adopt long names peppered with self-proclaimed titles and imagined or exaggerated accomplishments to alleviate their feelings of inadequacy. Some examples of mephit names follow. Anothoraxia, Lurker in Dark Places, the Tragic Hero, One Against AllSilothiscil the Embittered, Rimelord of the Eternal Chill, Lord of IciclesOglophax, Prince of Pungency, the Viscous One, the Forever StainZarnozath the Magnificent, First of His Name, Boiler of Kettles, the Teapot Terror
The four mephits presented here are but the most common of their kind. Others that rise from the mixing of elemental energies exist as well: creatures like dust mephits (who breathe out a scouring cloud of grit), ice mephits (who spit out sickening gusts of frozen air), magma mephits (which can assume the form of a pool of lava), ooze mephits (which spit out foul-smelling acid), salt mephits (who can draw moisture out of the environs and nearby creatures), and steam mephits (which can call down tiny squalls of boiling rain).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Dweomercat.
Dweomercats are magically gifted felines from the First World, where they prey upon other creatures and feed upon their primal energy. They are sometimes encountered in areas of the Material Plane where the veil to the First World is thin, or in regions where magic has been irreparably warped. Dweomercats are famous for their ability to twist the metaphorical strings of spells cast on or near them, which they can transform into their own defensive magic or tap into to instantly teleport across the battlefield.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a D'ziriak.
These strange creatures are native to the Plane of Shadows, where their colorful nature is in opposition to that realm's overwhelmingly monochromatic palette. Averaging 7 feet in height, D'ziriaks have four arms, two legs, and a termite-like abdomen. The larger pair of arms, used for most tasks, have five-fingered hands with sharp, insectile claws. The smaller pair of arms are reserved for fine manipulations and are not effective in combat.
D'ziriaks' otherwise dull brown carapaces are decorated with numerous runes glowing in bright colors. These tattoo-like runes indicate an individual's role in D'ziriak society, and set them apart from their home plane's other native inhabitants. The runes glow with natural bioluminescence, and D'ziriaks can make them flare brightly for an instant, at the expense of overstressing the biochemical glands that create and maintain the runes for an extended time. The color and shape of the runes are partially natural, but can be shaped and customized carefully over time to fit the individual's station.
The D'ziriak language is a mix of buzzes and chitters, and is spoken by few other creatures. D'ziriaks prefer to communicate with other species using telepathy rather than endure the sound of their language being "butchered by fleshy throats." D'ziriaks organize into hive cities led by a king and queen. These hive cities consist of impressive spires, yet these towers are only the foremost part of the settlement, with many more chambers reaching deep below for residences, workshops, and fungus farms. D'ziriak settlements are lit inside and out with alchemical and magical light sources, often in the shapes of runes. These dimly glowing towers provide travelers with landmarks, and perhaps promise safe havens, on the otherwise gloomy Shadow Plane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Eagle.
These large birds of prey swoop down from incredible heights to snatch fish and small mammals in their powerful talons. Eagles nest atop high trees or steep cliffs that provide a commanding view of the surrounding area. They avoid nesting too near civilization, but some remote cultures train eagles as hunting companions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Earthen Destrier.
This wave of dirt takes the crude likeness of the melded forequarters of a charging warhorse and a rocky knight wielding a rudimentary lance of gray stone.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Earth elementals sometimes have valuable gemstones or minerals incorporated into their bodies, and once they are slain, these valuables can be scavenged as treasure. Gemstones, precious metals such as silver or gold ore, or rarer materials such as mithral or adamantine can be harvested from these creatures, although the more expensive finds tend to be incorporated into only the most powerful earth elementals.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Earth Mephit.
Earth mephits are humorless and trudge about their tasks with little enthusiasm. They are somewhat more stout than other mephits, and their dark-brown or gray bodies are always coated with layers of dirt and filth. An earth mephit can fly, just as any other mephit, but the act of flight is uncomfortable and unnerving to them—they rarely ascend higher than 5 feet off the ground if they can help it.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Mephits are a favorite target for low-level spellcasters to summon, both because they have several useful abilities and because they are relatively easy to command and manipulate. Still, care must be taken when using mephits as minions, because if left unwatched or unattended for too long, they can cause all sorts of mischief.
Different types of mephits that can be found on the same elemental plane often develop friendly (or, in some cases, fierce) rivalries with one another. While mephits from elementally opposed planes (such as fire and water) may have strong opinions about the superiority of their own element, the fact that they rarely see such mephits means that when they do encounter them, they often get along better than they do with their close neighbors.
Perhaps because they're so often compelled into service by mortal conjurers and more powerful elementals, mephits tend to adopt long names peppered with self-proclaimed titles and imagined or exaggerated accomplishments to alleviate their feelings of inadequacy. Some examples of mephit names follow. Anothoraxia, Lurker in Dark Places, the Tragic Hero, One Against AllSilothiscil the Embittered, Rimelord of the Eternal Chill, Lord of IciclesOglophax, Prince of Pungency, the Viscous One, the Forever StainZarnozath the Magnificent, First of His Name, Boiler of Kettles, the Teapot Terror
The four mephits presented here are but the most common of their kind. Others that rise from the mixing of elemental energies exist as well: creatures like dust mephits (who breathe out a scouring cloud of grit), ice mephits (who spit out sickening gusts of frozen air), magma mephits (which can assume the form of a pool of lava), ooze mephits (which spit out foul-smelling acid), salt mephits (who can draw moisture out of the environs and nearby creatures), and steam mephits (which can call down tiny squalls of boiling rain).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Eberark.
The terrifying apex predators known as eberarks torment their prey, spewing oil from their mouths that they can then set alight. Commonly called flint beasts, eberarks drag their overlarge claws (four on each paw) along the ground as they move, creating showers of sparks with every grating step. Incredibly vain, eberarks relish displaying their dominance over other intelligent beings. Some eberarks conquer small settlements, demanding tribute from residents and travelers, or lead bands of violent brigands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Efreeti.
The efreet are hateful and merciless genies from the Plane of Fire, where they build metropolises and massive trade centers that draw extraplanar travelers from across the multiverse. They are cruel slavers, vengeful warmongers, and sinister wish-masters; there are many tales of mortals who made pacts with efreet only to have their words twisted to suit a genie’s capricious and malevolent whims.
Efreet do not readily treat with other genies; they share an eternal feud with the djinn, disdain marids, regard jann as weaklings unworthy of the genie title, and only occasionally tolerate alliances with shaitans. At 12 feet tall and weighing 2,000 pounds, efreet are formidable opponents and cow their chosen victims with a glance.
Genie nobles with titles unique to their kind (as detailed in each sidebar) rule genie society. Genie nobles are generally at least 5 levels higher than a typical example of their kind. In addition to the increased statistics afforded by their higher levels, genie nobles gain additional spells. But the most wondrous (and notorious) of a genie noble’s powers is their ability to grant wishes. Any genie noble (save for jann, who lack this power) can grant a mortal or undead creature up to three wishes within a year’s time. Many unscrupulous creatures compel genie nobles to serve them, tricking them or entrapping them with magic. However, once a genie noble grants a third wish to a single creature, they are freed from service to that creature forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Elananx.
These strange, fey felines resemble large, broad bobcats from a distance, but a closer view reveals something amiss. Their forms ripple and billow with heat, and their eyes glow from within as if they contain tiny, flickering flames. The pungent scent of rotting leaves smoldering in a bonfire clings to their fur. Yet those who have the chance to watch elananxes hunt or attack prey witness the greatest indication that these creatures are something more than mere predators, for they act with cruel and savvy instincts, reveling in the pain they infiict.
Elananxes typically hunt alone, but sometimes these cunning and malicious hunters of the First World roam in packs called “billows” to take down large prey. Like many house cats, elananxes are not content to merely track and devour prey, but prefer to toy with their victims, drawing joy and excitement from the fear and pain of those they capture. To this end, elananxes rarely use their cinder dispersal ability to evade their targets, instead opting to foil their quarry just before the end of the hunt—though, as selfish creatures who wish to live to hunt again, elananxes often reserve one use of this ability, just in case.
Because of their clever and malicious ways, elananxes are favored as hunting companions by redcaps, who go out of their way to befriend or make deals with these creatures. Redcaps also flnd great sport in hunts where competing elananxes chase a single creature. Although they’re large enough to serve as mounts for redcaps, elananxes despise being ridden and resist such attempts—little is as sure to cause a supposedly friendly elananx to turn on its redcap ally than a foolhardy attempt to treat the fey cat as a horse!
Elananxes have a strange affinity to forest fires. Because they are immune to the damage caused by flickering flames, they enjoy capering and caterwauling through the smoky, burning ruins of forest infernos. Some have even been known to use their burning bites to deliberately light undergrowth on fire, simply so they might experience the beauty of the flames combined with the inevitable pain such disasters inflict on other creatures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Elasmosaurus.
Elasmosauruses are long-necked, primeval reptiles that dwell in deep oceans and seas. Although not truly a dinosaur, elasmosauruses are often found in similar locations and are similarly titanic creatures. Keeping their massive bodies underwater, elasmosauruses use their long necks to catch prey and snorkel air to their massive lungs while remaining mostly hidden from the surface above. An elasmosaurus is 30 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds.
As rare and reclusive as they are, elasmosauruses are sometimes mistaken for even rarer creatures called water orms, legendary aquatic denizens of remote lakes known for their elusiveness and craftiness. Whereas elasmosauruses are mundane creatures of animalistic intelligence, water orms are magical beings with near-humanoid intelligence and a curious fascination with mortals, and they seem to delight in confounding onlookers. As a result, it's theorized that a typical water orm is more than happy to lead a group of spectators to a lost elasmosaurus, both to throw its pursuers off its tail and for the hilarity that will inevitably ensue.
While elasmosauruses are often found in lost worlds and unsettled regions, those who dwell in the oceans of the world do not contain their hunting grounds to specific regions. As a result, it's not unheard of for a wandering specimen to find its way to coastal waters. Those that do often find the ports of small towns or even large cities to be wondrous banquets and are usually hunted down by coastal guards or adventurers. When a wayward elasmosaurus like this finds its way into a city's sewer system or reservoirs, though, it can become the stuff of urban legends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Elder Wyrmwraith.
Wyrmwraiths rise from the souls of dragons who refuse to accept death or have an irrational fear of the afterlife.
The most powerful of these monsters, elder wyrmwraiths, sometimes form spontaneously from legendary dragons who were haunted with an irrational fear of the afterlife, but most are wyrmwraiths who have grown in power during an existence of well over a thousand years. The most powerful wyrmwraiths survive for millennia, typically by hiding away in remote caverns or wastelands and enacting their far-reaching plots through proxies. Some elder wyrmwraiths dedicate themselves to the pursuit of learning, but typically the only knowledge they crave is that which grants advantages against their enemies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Electric Eel.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Elemental Inferno.

More than other elementals, fire elementals tend to deviate from neutrality, and are often good, evil, or chaotic in nature. Lawful fire elementals are rare. Fire's inherently capricious nature seems to prevent these creatures from succumbing to the influence of order.

Often, nothing remains after defeating a fire elemental but a pile of ashes and the fading smell of smoke. But sometimes, fragments of their elemental power remain behind. At the GM's discretion, a fire elemental can leave behind ashes, lumps of charcoal, or ever-smoldering cinders that are valuable components for the construction of fire-themed magic items.
Though fire and water classically oppose one another, in the right mixture they can become a dangerous combination. Water elementals heated to a scalding temperature through natural factors such as underwater volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent fire damage with their Strikes, while fire elementals infused with moisture might exude clouds of obscuring or even blinding steam.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Elephant.
Those who live near elephants have learned to be wary of angering the beasts, but even with precautions in place, elephants sometimes still rampage. There is little an individual person can do when even a single elephant becomes enraged. Furthermore, a herd of angry or frightened elephants can easily destroy an entire village.
Elephant tusks are a highly sought-after treasure, the ivory from a single tusk potentially fetching hundreds of gold coins. Those who value the elephant’s majestic presence are impassioned defenders of the creatures, making the hunt for ivory dangerous.
Elephants of all species are, by nature, social creatures who form strong bonds with one another, but when an elephant separates from its herd—either due to tragedy or an individual streak of viciousness—they become known as rogue elephants. These dangerous solitary creatures are ill-tempered and quick to attack anything that approaches them, and often have the elite adjustments to their statistics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Eloko.
If a biloko is lucky enough to consume several spellcasters or other creatures with innate magical abilities, it undergoes a subtle transformation over the course of 1 week. Such a fey is known as an eloko, and in addition to their incredible appetite (even by biloko standards), they have the supernatural ability to grow to immense size.
A biloko looks like a slender but wiry humanoid with a head resembling a crocodile’s, rust-colored skin, and blood-red eyes. It eats only the meat of humanoids, though it can survive for extended periods of time on a single meal thanks to its snake-like ability to consume a typical Medium humanoid creature whole, which it does by unhinging its jaws and slowly swallowing the victim from head to foot. Thanks to its acidic saliva and sharp teeth, a biloko can masticate its food into an easy-to-digest pulp, grinding flesh and bone into a compact mush, even while swallowing, and does not flinch while devouring meals two or three times its own size. A biloko that has recently fed is easily recognizable by its distended belly, though the fey is no less dangerous then, as it delights in killing and might have hungry comrades hiding among nearby.
Bilokos’ connection to the First World grants them a limited ability to supernaturally charm their enemies. Bilokos use this power to lure stragglers away from their adventuring parties or confuse their opponents when a raid goes horribly awry. Large hunting parties of bilokos might charm entire groups of travelers, in which case these bilokos might bring their enchanted quarry back to their tribe to feast on (though they are more likely to simply enjoy the spoils of their efforts alone).
Bilokos prefer to move about in small, stealthy packs in dark, isolated sections of the jungle. When a band of bilokos finds a suitable hunting ground, it claims the area exclusively, digging pit traps, crafting snares from vines, and building blinds high in trees where the predators can lie in ambush.
In the jungles north of Lake Ocota, rumors speak of an incredibly powerful eloko who calls himself Emperor Sharptooth and rules over an entire city of bilokos and other fey. While such coordination between the capricious fey is not unheard of, explorers have been unable to verify these stories, as all who attempt to find the biloko settlement are never seen again. Recently, a group of Pathfinders based out of Nantambu has started collecting funds for an expedition to find this mysterious city and return with information (and possibly a wealth of treasure).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Elysian Titan.
Those titans who remained true to their creators earned their freedom. Many train aspiring champions of freedom, sacrifice, and selflessness.
Titans vary widely, depending on what function the deities intended them to serve or their methods of waging war. They include inflexible davana titans, warmongering hekatonkheires, armored fomorian titans, shapeshifting sashenji titans, and cunning citevi titans.
Some titans carry a fabled mattock of the titans. Good titans use it to build, while evil titans use it to destroy. Similar weapons include the felling axe of the titans, a greataxe that can be whirled to create a punishing winds effect.<|endoftext|>

At the GM's discretion, a fire elemental can leave behind ashes, lumps of charcoal, or ever-smoldering cinders that are valuable components for the construction of fire-themed magic items.
Though fire and water classically oppose one another, in the right mixture they can become a dangerous combination. Water elementals heated to a scalding temperature through natural factors such as underwater volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent fire damage with their Strikes, while fire elementals infused with moisture might exude clouds of obscuring or even blinding steam.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Emperor Bird.
The emperor bird is native to the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse and known for its brilliant plumage and innate magic. While it usually feeds on lizards, big insects, and other small creatures, the emperor bird is highly territorial and not afraid to attack larger prey. Its beak, resembling that of the much smaller peafowl, is exceptionally sharp, but its deadliest weapon is its tail—the long, whiplike blades of bone hidden among its tail feathers are a nasty surprise for any predator trying to sneak up on the bird.
The emperor bird was given its current name 2,000 years ago when Taldor’s Sixth Army of Exploration ventured into the Mwangi Expanse. When the legion spotted this 6-foot-long bird with its spectacular multicolored feathers trailing from its tail, wings, and crest, the soldiers thought the bird regal enough to suit their emperor, disregarding the name the Mwangi had given to the bird generations before, bebaki.
Keeping an emperor bird was, for many years, a sign of prestige among the nobility of Taldor. That was long ago, however, and emperor birds eventually fell out of fashion. Inevitably their former owners forgot about their colorful pets, and hundreds of neglected emperor birds were released back into the wild by weary servants. While many such freed birds perished quickly in the unfamiliar woodlands of Avistan, some managed to hold out, and emperor birds can still be encountered in the Verduran Forest.
The emperor bird uses its brilliant, iridescent plumage for mating displays as well as for intimidating rival suitors and potential predators. Not only are the feathers beautiful, but they are actually magical—a fact that has piqued the interest of alchemists and wizards alike, many of whom have spent decades capturing and breeding emperor birds in the hope of unlocking their arcane secrets. Mages stationed in the Mwangi Expanse will pay a pretty penny for intact feathers from these majestic creatures—or better yet, live specimens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Emperor Cobra.
These aggressive serpents infest bogs and lowlands. Despite a length of over 16 feet and weighing over 200 pounds, they can climb trees in seconds. An emperor cobra wards off predators by flaring its hood and hissing at its attacker.
Snakes of all sorts eat their meals by devouring their prey whole. After incapacitating a creature, a snake unhinges its jaw and consumes the creature entirely, even if it's more than twice the diameter of the snake's body. A snake can consume a creature of the same size as itself or smaller, but most snakes are logy and sluggish while the meal digests.
Snakeskin's distinctive pattern and wide variety of applications makes it a sought-after resource, and the hides of extra-large snakes such as giant anacondas can fetch a fine price in the right market. Such oversized snake hides can be used to craft clothing of snakeskin leather, including boots and gloves, as well as other items such as scabbards, backpacks, and even tents or makeshift boats. A snake's hide can be cleanly removed with a successful Crafting check or appropriate Lore check.
Snakes appear frequently and prominently in the myths and legends of many cultures throughout the Inner Sea region. In Ancient Osirion, snakes were revered and associated both with the evil serpent god Apep and the good goddess Wadjet, the Green Empress. Perhaps the best-known example of snakes in Golarion's legends are the serpentfolk— serpentine humanoids who ruled vast swaths of the world in prehistoric times and worshipped a foul snake deity called Ydersius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Eremite.
Eremites roam the planes to seek out ideal portions of other creatures, such as a hero's sword-arm or an angel's pinions. Eremites capture these specimens to clinically test their true limits, then harvest specimens and add them to their own bodies. An eremite might attach tongues to their hand as extra fingers or a fist to the back of their neck in a horrid “improvement.” Eremites average 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 200 pounds.
Velstracs manifest from the souls of masochistic or sadistic mortals that are diverted into the Shadow Plane and then forged into forms that suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the aesthetics-obsessed interlocutors.
Some mortals refer to velstracs as “kytons,” a misattribution that the velstracs tolerate with cold amusement. The term “kyton” denotes a master or virtuoso among their kind, and these fiends enjoy being labeled masters of their horrid paths to perfection through agony.

Velstracs originated with the first debased thoughts of mortals, which the gods found so deplorable that they locked all velstracs away in Hell. It wasn’t long, however, before the newly formed race of velstracs escaped their infernal prison to the Shadow Plane.
Velstracs originated with the first debased thoughts of mortals, which divine beings found so deplorable that they locked all velstracs away in Hell. It wasn't long, however, before the newly formed beings escaped their infernal prison to the Shadow Plane.
Scholars grimly joke that there are as many different kinds of velstracs as there are ways to skin a cat. The relatively diminutive cantor velstrac poisons the minds of its victims so that they believe they are being clawed from the inside out. The mighty eremites, on the other hand, seek out the most powerful beings to subsume into their own form and lord over all other velstracs save the demagogues.
There are as many different velstracs as there are ways to inflict pain. Other velstracs range in power from the relatively weak lampadariuses to the powerful phylacators.
Many velstracs outsource the forging of their chains to unique velstracs known as almoners. These six-armed, legless humanoids toil endlessly at a great burning foundry called the Shadow Forge. Almoners operate under mysterious strictures, and are just as likely to turn a velstrac away empty-handed as not.
Many velstracs forge their own chains, but others outsource the task to unique velstracs known as almoners. These blind, deaf, and mute velstracs resemble six-armed halflings severed at the waist that toil away endlessly at a great burning foundry called the Shadow Forge. Almoners operate under mysterious strictures, and are just as likely to turn a velstrac away empty-handed as they are to hand one a finely crafted chain before the request has even been uttered.
The most powerful velstracs are unique divinities known collectively as demagogues—powerful creatures often worshipped by mortals who seek to experience agonizing new revelations and gain power by enhancing the body through pain.

Velstracs are most often encountered in the shadowy realm of Nidal, where the state worship of Zon-Kuthon is rigidly enforced. Indeed, many velstracs are created from the souls of Joyful Things, devotees of Zon-Kuthon who have had their limbs amputated to focus their minds on the veneration of pain, sacrifice, and torment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Erinys (Fury Devil).
Erinyes exact vengeance and bloody justice for a creature’s crimes, torturing and punishing their victims in ironic fashion before allowing them the escape of death. While an erinys appears as a fallen angel and the first erinyes shared that origin, erinyes now originate in myriad ways, some promoted from lesser devils and others shaped from lemures themselves forged from the souls of torturers and persecutors. The erinyes’ origin is entwined with Eiseth, herself a fallen angel and one of Hell’s most powerful demigods. The first erinyes were all considered to be Eiseth’s metaphorical daughters, but erinyes formed since that time are no longer limited to a single gender.
At any one time, eight archdevils rule the eight upper layers of Hell, while the deepest layer is ruled by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a unique demigod with a dedicated role in guiding the infernal machine forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city. Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries, and Belial designs new weapons for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the oldest archdevil and keeper of many secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs armies. Baalzebul is a brooding archdevil who has fallen from Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty Mephistopheles was formed from the plane of Hell itself.
Many unique and powerful devils hold positions of power in Hell. The most numerous of these are the infernal dukes, many of whom were promoted to this position from already impressive statures as pit fiends. The supreme ruler of Hell itself is Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness. Between these two tiers rule the eight archdevils—see the sidebar on the facing page.
The nine layers of Hell are the planar home of all devils, and they much prefer its tyrannically ordered environs to anywhere else in the multiverse. Yet devils can be encountered anywhere mortals can be tempted by infernal bargains or seek diabolic aid. On Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is particularly aligned with Hell. Its government is based upon Hellʼs organization, and the state church is that of Asmodeus.
Devils view daemonsʼ constant hunt for souls as a short-sighted waste of potential, and demonsʼ chaotic destruction of society and flesh as uncivilized and obnoxious, but they do not loathe their fiendish counterparts. Indeed, most devils are more than willing to take advantage of daemons and demons as they can to further their own machinations.
Stinking, sulfurous hellfire is infused with evil. Hellfire always deals a combination of fire damage and evil damage, though the specific ratio depends on the hellfire's origin. Certain types of hellfire can impose other effects on creatures as well, such as sapping their strength or memories.
While travel to and from Hell is possible with plane shift, another way to reach and traverse the infernal realms is via hellmouths, strange living portals connecting different layers or even different planes. A hellmouth takes the form of a grimacing face, distended maw, or other distressingly organic aperture, and no two share the same appearance. Most are carefully guarded, but some new or well-hidden hellmouths have yet to be discovered.
The devils presented on these pages are a small sampling of the torments Hell has to offer. Other devils, like the inquisition-focused bone devils, the cherub-faced and fly-bodied accuser devils, and the aquatic drowning devil are a few examples of these widespread immortal creatures.
The four queens of the night wield great power in the Pit. Ardad Lili is a plotter and manipulator with ambitions of ruling the heavens, while Doloras revels in suffering. Most distant is Mahathallah, watching over fate and death. Mightiest among them is Eiseth, who is assembling an army in Dis in the hopes of claiming the iron throne of Malebolge.
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little use for compassion or empathy. As such, it exists entirely within a strict hierarchy, and this order extends to its denizens. While different types of demons correspond to various sins and daemons are associated with modes of mortal death, the different types of devils exist solely to fulfill particular roles in the infernal machine. On occasion, a particular devil can transcend the role for which they were literally shaped, but this often transforms the devil physically into the type suitable for their new role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Esobok.
Esoboks are brute hunters and pugnacious sentinels that serve as the guard dogs of the Boneyard. These squat, powerful quadrupeds have a frill of dark feathers around their distinctive heads which resemble a crocodile skull. Esoboks rarely bother with those who are truly dead, allowing the dead of the Boneyard to go about their business while remaining watchful for danger. Though cunning when sniffing out threats to the Boneyard or to their psychopomp handlers, they're among the least intelligent of the psychopomps and rarely speak except to utter growling threats. The wise listen when an esobok makes a threat, as it won't do so twice.
Nosois and morrignas are far from the only of their kind. Many others, like the skeletal vanths or the draconic yamarajes, also aid in the stewardship of the dead.
Psychopomps rarely oppose celestials or fiends. In fact, they frequently host such creatures in the Boneyard, particularly in the sprawling psychopomp courts where these outsiders petition for one soul or another to be remanded to their jurisdiction. Complicated cases are judged by yamarajes, while the thorniest or most politically delicate are handed by Pharasma herself.
Psychopomps' greatest enemies are creatures that devour or steal souls, such as astradaemons and night hags. Their other opponents include necromancers, proteans, and those who have unnaturally extended their lifespan, such as liches.
Some psychopomps view their task of sorting souls as ultimately hollow and meaningless, since the multiverse itself must one day end. Eons ago, these rebels shirked their duties and fled to the empty corners of the planes, becoming a new type of evil creature called a sahkil. Sahkils feed on mortal fears, particularly fears of death, and enjoy tormenting those who must die. Psychopomps generally leave these malcontents alone, except when sahkils interfere with the proper flow of souls.
The most powerful of the psychopomps are unique demigods known collectively as “ushers,” each of whom has its own cult. These psychopomp divinities include Atropos, the Last Sister; Barzahk, the Passage; Ceyanan, the Shepherd; Dammar, the Denied; Imot, the Symbol of Doom; Mother Vulture, the Flesheater; Mrtyu, Death's Consort; Narakas, the Cleansing Sentence; the Pale Horse; Phlegyas, Consoler of Atheists; Saloc, Minder of Immortals; Teshallas, the Primordial Poison; and Vale, the Court of the Ancestors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ether Spider.
Ether spiders are deadly predators from the Ethereal Plane resembling giant arachnids. Rather than building webs of silk, ether spiders shape the raw essence of the Ethereal Plane, weaving it in complex patterns that drift through the misty void. From these ethereal nests, whole families of ether spiders can scout the adjacent Material Plane, watching for easy prey in dark or remote corners of the land of mortals. Once an ether spider has spotted a meal, it anchors its nest and waits on the Ethereal Plane for its prey to draw near. As soon as its victim is within reach, the ether spider shifts to the Material Plane, clamps its fangs onto its prey, then shifts back to the Ethereal Plane to wait as its venom works through the creature’s system. Ether spiders move between the planes with ease, making them extremely dangerous to those who cannot see or attack ethereal enemies.
Ether spiders are not mindless or evil—they are simply hungry. If a prospective meal can sate an ether spider’s incredible appetite through other means, they might be able to bargain for their life. Ether spiders are especially interested in items, information, or allies who can help them against their enemies.
As many as half a dozen ether spiders might dwell in the same ether web. Although ether spiders enjoy one another’s company, they don’t form the same bonds as most humanoids, and they are more likely to feast on the corpse of a fallen sibling than save one from certain doom.
Ether spiders dwell in vast nests adrift in the Ghost World, where they are more likely to let down their guard. Travelers who find a floating ether spider commune should have an easier time of making peaceful contact to trade with or even befriend these strange arachnids. The nests drift on metaphysical currents and are rarely seen in the same vicinity twice. Sometimes a point of interest on the neighboring Material Plane compels them to tether their nest to an area, creating a semipermanent home, and those who learn its location can return to it repeatedly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ettin.
Two heads aren’t always better than one. The slovenly, violent giants known as ettins are proof enough of that.
The origin of these two-headed brutes is unknown, but few who encounter ettins ponder their beginnings for long. Rather, the first priority for most creatures during such a confrontation is escape, which is not easy to accomplish given the ettins’ notorious vigilance. In this way, two heads are better than one—ettins regularly find employ in the ranks of giant or orc armies as sentries and guards. The benefits of an ettin security detail are obvious: because it has a shared stomach, an ettin requires only the same amount of food as one typical ogre, yet its two sets of eyes make it twice as observant. An ettin never complains for lack of company, either. The ettin’s two heads are uniquely content to squabble and converse between themselves, and though they bicker incessantly, most couldn’t dream of life without the other. Much like some twins, an ettin has two individual minds who nonetheless consider the other as much a part of their life as their own self.
Ettins do not resemble a single giant heritage so much as an amalgamation of several. Their tusks are thought to stem from orc ancestry, though their size and dimness suggest hill giant blood. Though they tower over goblins and hobgoblins, ettins are more than at home among tribes of these creatures and enjoy their comfortable stations as camp lookouts or troop rearguards. Their exposure to a wide variety of goblinoids and giants is evident in their language; ettins speak a pidgin tongue of Goblin, Jotun, and Orcish, and their diction is mostly good enough to get across the general meaning of their short sentences and bumbled sayings—although most interlocutors simply nod their heads while conversing with an ettin anyway. The monsters are notoriously short tempered and, despite their heightened visual perception, short sighted in matters of keeping their allies alive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Evangelist.
Evangelists, the velstracs' unofficial ambassadors, roam the farthest reaches of the planes to spread the word of their kind's abhorrent belief in perfection through pain. They are therefore the most frequently encountered velstracs on the Material Plane, leading covens of hedonistic mortal flesh-sculptors or serving as wardens of horrific dungeons. In regions ruled by infernal powers, evangelists may serve as lieutenants or advisors, whispering secret paths to power in exchange for mortal's souls or choice mortal flesh. Evangelists are the same size as humans, although with the heavy chains that always drape their forms, they often weigh 350 pounds or more.
Velstracs manifest from the souls of masochistic or sadistic mortals that are diverted into the Shadow Plane and then forged into forms that suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the aesthetics-obsessed interlocutors.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Excorion.
These hideous undead creatures result from an exquisitely painful necromantic process where flayed humanoids are animated through their exposed blood vessels. Cults of undeath typically punish apostates and renegades with this cruel method of reanimation, though sacrificial victims or unfortunate prisoners might suffer a similar fate. Excorions have supernaturally strong, pulsing veins that extend outward from their bodies like thousands of tiny, bloody cilia.
Excorions move their bulks not with their dead muscles, but with heaving contractions of their blood vessels that pull them along in a swift but jerky manner. Excorions can shift their magical blood easily throughout their bodies, allowing them to squirt blood from their gaping, skinless mouths or to messily mark their foes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Faceless Butcher.
The deformed flesh on this humanoid horror’s head bears grim holes where their eyes, nose, mouth, and ears should be, and little else. Stories of faceless butchers always center on the monstrous murderer’s preferred weapon: a wicked and bloodstained meat cleaver, which the butcher uses to carve flesh from skull to add to their collection of stolen faces. Once they’ve taken a victim’s face, the faceless butcher can wear it, transform into an exact replica of the deceased, and begin stalking their next victim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Faceless Stalker (Ugothol).
Among the subtler of the alghollthu creations were the ugothols—also known as faceless stalkers. These twisted beings used shapeshifting to infiltrate settlements and assassinate key targets. They sowed discord and replaced leaders, causing unwanted organizations to implode and bothersome people to lose face and eventually disappear. Entirely terrestrial in nature, ugothols can easily extend alghollthu plots above the waves for extended periods of time, giving their aquatic masters enhanced reach into these unpleasantly dry realms. Today, most faceless stalkers—like the less dangerous ulat-kinis—pursue programmed goals without the guidance of alghollthu rule. Faceless stalkers prefer to live as close to the sea coast as possible, although they are not aquatic creatures themselves. Most dwell in tiny tribes in marshlands. Others live in the sewers of coastal towns.
By instinct, faceless stalkers seek to sow discord. They replace leaders in humanoid societies, then guide infiltrated settlements down paths of destruction. Among humanoids who have wicked tendencies, a faceless stalker can become a prominent trailblazer, leading a group to new heights of depravity and violence. Inevitably, however, faceless stalker infiltrators lead their followers to ruin. The ugothol eventually moves on—either because its true nature is about to be discovered, or because it has despoiled or devastated all local resources.
An ugothol gains nourishment only through its long, bloodsucking tongue. Their prey bear distinctive triple puncture wounds near major arteries. Corpses bearing such marks are typically the first clues found to uncover a faceless stalker’s presence, though sometimes they are overlooked as marks belonging to a vampire or chupacabra.
In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave societies and sought to wipe the slate clean—both starting anew and punishing those who had become too willful and rebellious. They used incredible magical power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they’d manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew strong once again—this time without alghollthu influence.
Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a frightening possibility—that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the surface once again.
The ruling castes of the alghollthu species dwell in oceanic depths or underground waterways, while their servitors like ulat-kinis and ugothols can often be found in coastal regions and marshes.
Although most alghollthus lack the greed that tempts most mortals, they do gather wealth and magical tools to use in their schemes. A given aboleth or veiled master might also wear magical jewelry and other objects. Faceless stalkers and other humanoid servants of alghollthus use weapons and armor, such as the faceless stalker’s sword or ulat-kini’s trident, as well as other tools. These servitor races can be as acquisitive as other humanoids.
While the veiled masters are the rulers of alghollthu society, they are not the most powerful of their kind. Greater, more mysterious creatures that function as organic thought networks, immense aquatic engines of war, or specialized extractors of forgotten secrets dwell among their sunken cities. Meanwhile, the world above remains infested with creatures that were originally created by the alghollthus but have long since drifted away from their aquatic progenitors to become their own sinister monstrosities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Faerie Dragon.
Although they are much smaller than their larger dragon cousins, faerie dragons have the many of the same physiological attributes, including long necks, toothy maws, sinuous tails, and sharp claws. They flit about on iridescent butterfly wings, the coloring of which changes based on where they live, giving them a natural camouflage. Unlike their larger kin, an adult faerie dragon remains the same size throughout its lifespan. The only visual clue to the age of a faerie dragon is the sheen on its scales, a glimmer that becomes more lustrous the older it gets.
Faerie dragons usually exhibit pleasant and good-natured temperaments, though they have a mischievous streak that leads them to play tricks on those around them. In search of an amusement, they prefer harmless annoyances to wounding malice. While often spontaneous, they may also spend months if not years planning the perfect prank. Especially responsive targets endear themselves to faerie dragons and may create a lifelong bond. A faerie dragon’s reputation as a trickster leads many to associate them with fey, with whom the tiny dragons have cordial relationships.
Peaceful by nature, faerie dragons do not enjoy confrontation. If faced with hostility, they prefer to remain at a distance and breathe euphoric gas at their foes, diffusing the skirmish by creating an atmosphere of bliss. If conflict escalates, they target their opponents with spells, using their renowned trickery to escape. If their companions are in danger, however, their desire to remain out of combat changes. Faerie dragons protect their friends by any means available, including physical combat.
Sometimes as faerie dragons grow older, their connection to the First World grows stronger. In addition to growing more lustrous and vibrant in appearance, these faerie dragons gain an increasing amount of magical primal power. Such faerie dragons increase in strength as appropriate—a faerie dragon of 20th level or even higher is possible, but it is exceptionally unusual to encounter a faerie dragon of 9th level or higher beyond the most remote regions of the First World. When creating a more powerful faerie dragon, change its tradition to primal and grant it a number of primal spells known appropriate for a druid of its level. Faerie dragons don’t grow much larger, regardless of how powerful they become. Those who would seek to torment or vex a faerie dragon would do well to consider this, as it’s often difficult to tell how powerful one of these tiny dragons truly is at a simple glance!
Faerie dragon hide can be made into armor for a Small creature. They sometimes wear magical amulets or rings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Fen Mosquito Swarm.
When deadly fen mosquitoes gather in large numbers, they form into lethal swarms capable of draining blood at a truly alarming rate. Fen mosquito swarms are typically encountered only in tropical swamps or bogs, but during humid months in spring or summer they can drift into riverine areas or even through the waterfront reaches of settlements.
This pernicious disease is often associated with mosquitoes. The most common version of malaria is presented on page 118 of the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide, and while the variants inflicted by mosquito swarms and giant mosquitoes are deadlier, they don't have the chance to recur after 1d4 months. Pyrexic malaria also causes weakness and fevers, while septic malaria causes painful and infected lesions to form on the body. Regardless of the strain you contract, you can't reduce your sickened condition while you are affected with malaria.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Fetchling Scout.
The people known today as fetchlings are a distinct ancestry descended from generations of humans who became trapped ages ago on the Shadow Plane. No longer human at all, these people, who call themselves kayals, have become monochromatic in coloration, with flesh tones and hair colors varying between white, black, and all shades of gray. Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow.
Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane, often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d'ziriaks. While individual fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment, which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks or concealing clothing to hide their appearance.
Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don't mind traveling to and blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the worst of interlopers might make sense to some.
Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane; most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere, exiles who were banished from their homelands, or planar castaways with no ability to return to the Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded, are the most likely to be found in larger groups. In cities of significant size, one can sometimes even find a small community of a few dozen or more fetchlings living among humans, although they often do so subtly by dyeing their hair, wearing brightly colored clothing, and utilizing layers of makeup to hide their pallid complexions.
Kayals understand that many Material Plane cultures view them with suspicion or even fear, and take pains to adapt to cultures with which they seek to establish trade. Unfortunately, kayals' mastery at cultural adaptation can often backfire, leading to fears that the so-called “fetchlings” are an invading force that seeks to duplicate and replace those with whom they merely wish to do business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Filth Fire.
These creatures look like roiling clouds of black smoke churning above a mound of burning refuse. Leering faces form and fade in the smoke above, while the burning trash writhes in spasmodic lurches, obviously alive.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
More than other elementals, fire elementals tend to deviate from neutrality, and are often good, evil, or chaotic in nature. Lawful fire elementals are rare. Fire's inherently capricious nature seems to prevent these creatures from succumbing to the influence of order.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Often, nothing remains after defeating a fire elemental but a pile of ashes and the fading smell of smoke. But sometimes, fragments of their elemental power remain behind. At the GM's discretion, a fire elemental can leave behind ashes, lumps of charcoal, or ever-smoldering cinders that are valuable components for the construction of fire-themed magic items.
Though fire and water classically oppose one another, in the right mixture they can become a dangerous combination. Water elementals heated to a scalding temperature through natural factors such as underwater volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent fire damage with their Strikes, while fire elementals infused with moisture might exude clouds of obscuring or even blinding steam.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Fire Giant.
The most militaristic of all giants, fire giants focus obsessively on learning combat techniques, mastering the arts of forging weapons and armor, and finding new ways to dominate their enemies. As a result, their social and political structures are grounded firmly in martial hierarchies, with a strict emphasis on following the orders of one’s superior, no matter if you are accountable to a lowly soldier or report to a powerful officer. As soon as a fire giant can walk, they are fitted with their first suit of forged armor. This armor is constantly remolded and replaced as the fire giant matures, both to ensure they are comfortable with steel against their skin and also to teach the giant as early as possible that they bear the burden of fighting to protect their traditions and way of life. To a fire giant, death is the flame in which the future is forged.
Fire giants are usually identified by their powerful stature, bright-orange hair that flickers and dances as if it were aflame, and heavy steel armor worn over garments of crimson, amber, or black. Most fire giants are covered in scars and refuse to conceal or obstruct them, as each jagged mark serves as a reminder of a valuable lesson they learned in battle. A typical fire giant stands 12 to 16 feet tall, weighs about 7,000 pounds, and lives to be 350 years old.
Giants often keep an eclectic collection of treasures in their knapsacks or bags. Among these can be found a staggeringly wide range of unexpected and odd treasures and valuables.
As oversized as they are, giants tend to dwell in remote regions of the world, where they have the luxury of claiming larger territories of their own.
As with many people, giants enjoy keeping pets. Yet for giants, what constitutes a pet is often categorized as beast to others. Large animals like bears and lions, and megafauna like woolly mammoths and dinosaurs are popular, as are more magical creatures like hell hounds, manticores, griffons, and the like.
Beyond the giants detailed here, many others dwell in remote regions of the world. Marsh giants are cultists who worship strange sea deities, shadow giants have ties to the Shadow Plane, and mountain giants are horrific butchers even other giants fear.
Giants are larger-than-life foes. While many giants have themes that tie them to elemental or magical forces, the primary theme giants share is that they embody a classic cultural trope as their basis. Fire giants, for example, can be seen as oversized smiths, while hill giants should evoke the flavor of an oversized bully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Fire Jellyfish Swarm.
While individually one of these fist-sized jellyfish is merely a nuisance, in great numbers, fire jellyfish can form into dangerous swarms. Bobbing in the water, they create a cloud of stinging tentacles. They were named in part for their bright coloration, but those who are stung by fire jellyfish learn the larger reason for their name—the pain of their stings is comparable to being burned alive.
A large number of types of monstrous jellyfish dwell in the worldfs oceans, each with their own unusual specialty in hunting. The immense vampire jellyfish is a blood-drinking monster that often attacks sailors aboard ships. Among the largest are the dreaded whaler jellyfish, colossal creatures that feed on whales or even krakens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Fire Mephit.
Fire mephits are conniving and quick to anger. They aren’t evil, but they delight in inflicting pain, and their love of burning things pushes them the closest to this alignment of all mephits. They have bright-orange skin, and wisps of flame flicker along their wings as they flap through the air. The rivalry between fire and water mephits is notorious, and these creatures loathe working together for any amount of time.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Mephits are a favorite target for low-level spellcasters to summon, both because they have several useful abilities and because they are relatively easy to command and manipulate. Still, care must be taken when using mephits as minions, because if left unwatched or unattended for too long, they can cause all sorts of mischief.
Different types of mephits that can be found on the same elemental plane often develop friendly (or, in some cases, fierce) rivalries with one another. While mephits from elementally opposed planes (such as fire and water) may have strong opinions about the superiority of their own element, the fact that they rarely see such mephits means that when they do encounter them, they often get along better than they do with their close neighbors.
Perhaps because they're so often compelled into service by mortal conjurers and more powerful elementals, mephits tend to adopt long names peppered with self-proclaimed titles and imagined or exaggerated accomplishments to alleviate their feelings of inadequacy. Some examples of mephit names follow. Anothoraxia, Lurker in Dark Places, the Tragic Hero, One Against AllSilothiscil the Embittered, Rimelord of the Eternal Chill, Lord of IciclesOglophax, Prince of Pungency, the Viscous One, the Forever StainZarnozath the Magnificent, First of His Name, Boiler of Kettles, the Teapot Terror
The four mephits presented here are but the most common of their kind. Others that rise from the mixing of elemental energies exist as well: creatures like dust mephits (who breathe out a scouring cloud of grit), ice mephits (who spit out sickening gusts of frozen air), magma mephits (which can assume the form of a pool of lava), ooze mephits (which spit out foul-smelling acid), salt mephits (who can draw moisture out of the environs and nearby creatures), and steam mephits (which can call down tiny squalls of boiling rain).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Firewyrm.
Firewyrms live in tubes of molten lava found throughout the Plane of Fire.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Fire Yai.
Fire yai take the form of fire giants. Like fire giants, fire yai are shrewd and militaristic and have an incredible appetite for the thrill of war. While they engage in battle to conquer and control others, fire yai also love the thrill of war, fighting for the sheer joy of it. Presenting a fire yai with a true challenge in combat can potentially earn their mercy and an offer to join and serve at their side. Fire yai's third eyes shoot forth burning missiles of fire.
When an oni manifests, they always do so in a form that parodies a specific humanoid ancestry closely associated with the oni’s obsessions and envies. Giants’ over-the-top personalities and sizes are likely the reason why these humanoids are the most common incarnations chosen by oni; such oni are known collectively as yai oni. Yet there exist oni associated with almost every kind of humanoid. Most oni are capable of supernaturally disguising themselves as their associated humanoid type and use this ability to infiltrate societies and seize control from within. Once established, oni typically reveal their true form and revel in dominating those they view as lesser beings fit only to serve their whims.
Oni are nothing if not vain. They typically choose comely or striking appearances in their humanoid disguises—forms that are completely at odds with the ugliness of their true natures. An oni’s true form is indicative of their innermost desires and always has features such as oversized teeth that verge into tusks, sharp claws, unusually bright skin colors, or a third eye in the forehead. Oni have desires as varied as those of any being, though by their nature these desires are almost always for hedonistic or destructive experiences of the flesh, typically food, pleasure, or violence.
Oni daimyo are quasi-deities with isolated mortal domains. The most powerful is Inma, the Empress of the World, but Akuma the Horned King, Murona the Dark Mother, and Nataka the Red King are also worshipped.
The first oni originated in the nation of Minkai on the continent of Tian Xia. Whether due to prevalent local kami— particularly in the mist-shrouded Forest of Spirits—or its peoples' faiths, Minkai is a hotbed of oni activity.
Oni humanoid forms are limited to one specific appearance. An ogre magecan assume only one specific ogre form, while an ice yai can appear only as one specific frost giant. Some oni have greater control over their shapeshifting power and can assume the form of any humanoid creature, and these oni tend to be the most dangerous.
Different oni exist for nearly every humanoid ancestry. Kuwa oni mask their golden skin and four-fingered claws in human form, while ja oni hide as hobgoblins. Other yai include wind yai (who take their form from cloud giants) and the immensely powerful void yai (who form from other yai and ascend to rule over rune giants).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Fjord Linnorm.
Fjord linnorms make their homes in damp caves behind ice-cold waterfalls in the river-veined coastal reaches of the north. While they may appear graceful as they swim up the fjords for which they're named, they are as vile as any other of their species and take pleasures in capsizing river boats before gobbling up their terrified crews.
The death curses of the linnorms are often the subjects of tragic sagas, and those who would think themselves vanquishing heroes for slaying a linnorm often meet their dooms soon thereafter, succumbing to these curses well after the death of the linnorm responsible for bestowing it.
Linnorms have a deep connection to the First World, the primordial home of the fey. While linnorms typically won't think twice before devouring a gnome or other fey, they do have an unusual respect for wielders of powerful primal magic. The only way to cow a linnorm, according to common wisdom, is to remind it that there are forces of nature even stronger than itself.
In the storied Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the slaying of a linnorm is traditionally required for those who would claim a nation’s crown. Recently, though, the Linnorm King White Estrid claimed her crown not by slaying a linnorm but by beating it into submission, gaining a powerful and dangerous ally to help secure her rule.
Creatures as powerful as linnorms tend to spawn stories of their own, accurate or not. Critical failure on a check to Recall Knowledge on linnorms might suggest that you can avoid a linnorm's death curse by closing your eyes as you deliver the fatal blow, or that rubbing poison oak on yourself can ward off a linnorm's attention.
As with true dragons, linnorms tend to amass immense piles of treasure in their lairs. These hoards consist of the weapons, gear, and belongings of would-be vanquishers more often than minted coins or works of art.
Almost all linnorms lead solitary lives; they are too reprehensible for even their own kind to tolerate for any length of time. Most species do not even meet to reproduce; rather, female linnorms usually deposit a solitary egg in a remote location, which a wandering male linnorm then fertilizes and places in a nook suitable for incubation. Newborn linnorms range in size from that of adult crocodiles to full-grown bulls, and their growth is rapid. Even a juvenile linnorm is strong enough to wreak havoc on a small settlement— though most don't dare to commit such audacious pillaging, for fear of evoking the anger of another, larger linnorm in the area.
Linnorms exist in a variety of forms beyond the four detailed here. The gaunt cairn linnorm, the spiny taiga linnorm, and the aquatic fjord linnorm each terrorize their own specific regions of the Material Plane.
While the linnorms presented here and in the first Bestiary constitute the majority of these creatures, others exist, particularly in the remote regions of the First World. It may be that these rare linnorms simply find the Material Plane too constraining for their might!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Flame Drake.
The distant kin of red dragons, flame drakes thankfully lack the intelligence and ambition of their larger cousins, but are no less territorial or violent. Flame drakes dwell near volcanoes and magma, but it’s not unheard of for one to drift into nearby areas like forests or wooded hills. Their scales are usually some shade of red, occasionally fading to smoky blacks and grays along the edges of their wings and the tips of their tails.
Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.
While drake hides aren’t any more valuable than those of other, similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. While they are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.
A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.
A drake egg has Hardness 3, 5 HP, and BT 5. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.
Once a drake hatches, it imprints on the first creature that it sees. A creature imprinted on in this way gains a +5 bonus to Nature checks to train or command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the region, the type of drake, and the exact purpose the buyer has in mind, but typically depends on the level of the drake. Because drakes are evil, dangerous, and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.
It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconfidence, or general lack of skill.
Drakes reach maturity and reproduce much earlier than dragons, meaning that they are a far more common threat than their more powerful forebears. Drakes have few qualms about dwelling with one another (provided they are the same species), often establishing dens in pockets of wilderness suitable to their needs, such as swampy grottoes, shallow shoreline caves, or cliffside perches.
The allure of hunting a dragon is difficult to resist for many adventurers, but accomplishing such a task is fraught with peril. Unscrupulous adventurers have been known to instead hunt drakes and use trophies harvested from these creatures to deceive locals.
While the different species of drakes are adapted to different climates and environments, many drakes share similar preferences regarding nest location, searching out high places that offer cover from above, such as cliffside or mountaintop caverns, jungle canopies, and so on.
While every adventurer knows that dragon hide can be crafted into potent armor or weapons, drake hide holds no such intrinsic value. Nonetheless, drake scales and horns are physically impressive, and to the uneducated buyer, might seem at first glance to be legitimate. Unscrupulous leatherworkers have been known to use drake hides to craft and sell counterfeit dragonhide armor, so potential buyers should remain on the lookout for scams.
Drakes share dragon’s interest in treasure, but lack dragons’ discerning taste. A drake hoard will certainly contain coins, jewelry, gemstones, gear, and even the odd magic item or two, but the bulk of the hoard invariably consists of broken weapons, shiny rocks, bits of junk, and other doubtful pieces of refuse.
Although drakes and dragons are related to one another, little love is lost between them, and even the most territorial drakes know better than to remain in a dragon's territory longer than they have to. In rare cases, large rampages of drakes band together to attack an encroaching dragon, especially if the dragon is young and inexperienced.
The drakes presented on these pages are far from the only types that exist. Forest drakes have green hides, spit acidic clouds, and can be found in temperate woodlands. Rift drakes, among the most powerful of their kind, spit clinging caustic vapors and dwell in badlands and regions scarred by devastating magical disasters. Sea drakes can be found in oceans across the world, lava drakes in volcanic crevasses, mist drakes along coastlines and in salt marshes, and spire drakes in ragged, rocky hills. Undoubtedly, many other types of drakes lurk in the far corners of the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Flash Beetle.
These 3-foot-long insects boast a pair of glowing organs on the back of the abdomen that give off bright light and that continue to glow for days, even after the creature’s death. Flash beetles are commonly herded and harvested by miners and spelunkers, as their glow is considered safer than torches and less expensive than lamps. Denizens of the Darklands often domesticate and train these insects, using them as pets, livestock, or caging them to use as organic sources of light in areas frequented by visitors unaccustomed to the darkness.
Numerous other species of giant beetle exist in the wilds. Duergars train deep-dwelling beetles as mounts and guardians. Bombardier beetles can spew caustic acid as a potent attack. And the truly immense goliath beetles can devastate entire buildings or even castles with frightening ease.
Beetles do not collect treasure, but the two light-producing organs of a flash beetle can be recovered from the creature and used for illumination-based chemical recipes, spell components, and magic item creation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Flea Swarm.
Flea swarms roil across city streets and rural hinterlands in a hissing, scraping scrabble, draining blood from any creatures unfortunate enough to cross their path.
Flea swarms and giant fleas make for natural pets and monstrous minions for creatures who live in areas of filth and concentrated populations. Goblins and gremlins are unperturbed by fleas’ disturbing physiologies and are unfazed (though not necessarily unaffected) by the diseases these vermin carry. Ratfolk have been known to tame giant fleas for use as mounts, and urban-dwelling druids whose magic focuses on blight or disease naturally find much to like about the flea swarms they frequently summon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Flesh Golem.
Made of odd scraps of skin and muscle, a flesh golem is a grotesque parody of life. Though it has no mind, it can still go into a berserk rage when harmed, giving it a faint semblance of emotion. Flesh golems guard the laboratories and charnel houses of fleshwarpers and necromancers who feel no compunctions about desecrating corpses for their own ends. Though the first flesh golem is believed to have been a misguided attempt to create from simple base elements, these monstrosities are far from human. In isolated cases, echoes of a personality might rise in a flesh golem if the brain used as part of its construction belonged to a particularly powerful personality, but such tragic instances are (thankfully) rare in the extreme.
Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called “golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.
Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell can affect the golem.
Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.
Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.
Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Flytrap Leshy.
While often seen as unfriendly by non-leshys, flytrap leshys get along well with other leshys. Nonetheless, they're among the most aggressive leshys, often guarding the most vulnerable places in the natural world with their flytrap mouths and hands.
When a large threat emerges, pairs of flytrap leshys band together to create amalgams capable of driving back powerful foes. This unusual form of communal defense suffuses flytrap leshy society, and they often form relationships between multiple individuals that would confuse or even scandalize more uptight humanoids—to a flytrap leshy, though, there's nothing strange about sharing your innermost secrets with people you literally merged together with to defend your home from an enemy.
Because of their relative frailty, leaf leshys frequently act as liaisons and call upon more powerful forest guardians when their domains are threatened. Nymphs, sprites, and other goodly fey may respond to the call of a leaf leshy, as do arboreals and other plant creatures.
When a leshy dies, its body explodes in a wave of vegetation as its spirit returns to the natural world. Though leshy spirits that are called into new bodies after death typically keep only vague recollections of their pasts, they retain many of the values and habits of their former life.
Leshys are fairly egalitarian when interacting with their own kind. Most communities are meritocracies, rewarding leshys who defend their communities and help each other succeed, and they see working together as the best path to a successful future.
Occasionally, a leshy proves so valuable to their community that they're uplifted as a hero. These admired leshys are not all warriors; outstanding artisans, caretakers, or diplomats might also be lauded as heroes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Forge-Spurned.
Evil dwarves who die having failed to live up to the exacting standards of the duergar god Droskar are sometimes forced to return to the material world as undead abominations known as forge-spurned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Froghemoth.
A terrifying abomination of teeth, tentacles, and unbridled rage, the froghemoth is thankfully rarely encountered even in the deepest swamplands or most remote Darklands caverns. Capable of devouring dinosaurs and even dragons, it is a frighteningly effective ambush hunter, immersing itself in the mire with only its eyestalk protruding and watching in every direction at once with uncanny precision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Frost Drake.
Frost drakes pose an immense danger in the frozen reaches they call home, where they roam far and wide to hunt for prey such as caribou, wolves, small bears, and tundra-dwelling people. Related as they are to white dragons, these drakes share many habits and facets of their disposition with their draconic cousins. Indeed, just as white dragons are among the most bestial and craven of dragonkind, frost drakes are among the most depraved and openly malicious of the drakes. They are also especially insolent, and are less likely to back down from a flight compared to other drakes. Many frost drakes have met their ends trying to enact cruelties beyond their means, such as singly taking on an entire castle or well-fortified township. Although a frost drake can wreak much destruction on its own, tales of village-dwelling northerners banding together to defend their homes from these rogue menaces are fairly common.
A frost drake’s hunting grounds are quite large. Those frost drakes that live upon the permanently frozen peaks of high mountains have been known to swoop down to snatch up prey from the lowlands, leaving frozen swaths of earth from their breath as the only sign of their passing. Their frost-covered scales range from deep royal blue to crisp cyan and sometimes feature sporadic patches of violet. Their hides are thinner than most drakes’; when a frost drake is inhaling in preparation to launch its signature frozen breath, the monster’s ice-blue blood can be seen beneath its scales.
Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead.

The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the region, the type of drake, and the exact purpose the buyer has in mind, but typically depends on the level of the drake. Because drakes are evil, dangerous, and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.
It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconfidence, or general lack of skill.
Drakes reach maturity and reproduce much earlier than dragons, meaning that they are a far more common threat than their more powerful forebears. Drakes have few qualms about dwelling with one another (provided they are the same species), often establishing dens in pockets of wilderness suitable to their needs, such as swampy grottoes, shallow shoreline caves, or cliffside perches.
The allure of hunting a dragon is difficult to resist for many adventurers, but accomplishing such a task is fraught with peril. Unscrupulous adventurers have been known to instead hunt drakes and use trophies harvested from these creatures to deceive locals.
While the different species of drakes are adapted to different climates and environments, many drakes share similar preferences regarding nest location, searching out high places that offer cover from above, such as cliffside or mountaintop caverns, jungle canopies, and so on.
While every adventurer knows that dragon hide can be crafted into potent armor or weapons, drake hide holds no such intrinsic value. Nonetheless, drake scales and horns are physically impressive, and to the uneducated buyer, might seem at first glance to be legitimate. Unscrupulous leatherworkers have been known to use drake hides to craft and sell counterfeit dragonhide armor, so potential buyers should remain on the lookout for scams.
Drakes share dragon’s interest in treasure, but lack dragons’ discerning taste. A drake hoard will certainly contain coins, jewelry, gemstones, gear, and even the odd magic item or two, but the bulk of the hoard invariably consists of broken weapons, shiny rocks, bits of junk, and other doubtful pieces of refuse.
Although drakes and dragons are related to one another, little love is lost between them, and even the most territorial drakes know better than to remain in a dragon's territory longer than they have to. In rare cases, large rampages of drakes band together to attack an encroaching dragon, especially if the dragon is young and inexperienced.
The drakes presented on these pages are far from the only types that exist. Forest drakes have green hides, spit acidic clouds, and can be found in temperate woodlands. Rift drakes, among the most powerful of their kind, spit clinging caustic vapors and dwell in badlands and regions scarred by devastating magical disasters. Sea drakes can be found in oceans across the world, lava drakes in volcanic crevasses, mist drakes along coastlines and in salt marshes, and spire drakes in ragged, rocky hills. Undoubtedly, many other types of drakes lurk in the far corners of the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Frost Giant.
Frost giants are remorseless marauders who pillage and plunder from those who dare to live near them in desolate, frigid lands. Their clans range from extremely territorial hunters who claim an expanse of tundra and defend it at all costs to nomadic hordes that roam icy slopes in search of settlements to conquer. Frost giant clans are ruled by those who exhibit the greatest ferocity and prowess in battle—massive brutes who proclaim themselves jarl and demand absolute obedience from their followers. If at any time a frost giant wishes to be a jarl, all they must do is issue a challenge to the current jarl and face off in mortal combat, after which the reigning champion continues leading the clan or the victorious challenger assumes control.
Frost giants live in frostbitten realms, and their appearance is reflective of a people weathered and hardened by relentless snowstorms and freezing temperatures. They often wear metal armor adorned with the furs, skin, teeth, and tusks of slain beasts and heft weapons as long as dining tables. Their flesh ranges from pale blue to shale gray, and their hair is typically a dingy white or dirty yellow color.
A typical frost giant stands about 15 feet tall and weighs approximately 2,800 pounds.
Giants often keep an eclectic collection of treasures in their knapsacks or bags. Among these can be found a staggeringly wide range of unexpected and odd treasures and valuables.
As oversized as they are, giants tend to dwell in remote regions of the world, where they have the luxury of claiming larger territories of their own.
As with many people, giants enjoy keeping pets. Yet for giants, what constitutes a pet is often categorized as beast to others. Large animals like bears and lions, and megafauna like woolly mammoths and dinosaurs are popular, as are more magical creatures like hell hounds, manticores, griffons, and the like.
Beyond the giants detailed here, many others dwell in remote regions of the world. Marsh giants are cultists who worship strange sea deities, shadow giants have ties to the Shadow Plane, and mountain giants are horrific butchers even other giants fear.
Giants are larger-than-life foes. While many giants have themes that tie them to elemental or magical forces, the primary theme giants share is that they embody a classic cultural trope as their basis. Fire giants, for example, can be seen as oversized smiths, while hill giants should evoke the flavor of an oversized bully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Frost Troll.
Frost trolls are nightmarish frozen monsters of rime-stained claws and hoarfrost teeth. Possessing wits superior to those of common trolls, frost trolls often hunt in packs of three—one attacking their quarry openly while the remaining two pause to assess weaknesses before moving in for the kill. Frost trolls relish the taste of human flesh and adjust their hunting grounds seasonally to remain in close proximity to their favorite prey. Of slighter frame than common trolls, a typical frost troll stands 11 feet tall when not hunched and weighs 900 pounds. Their sickly, cracked flesh is of an icy, cerulean pallor. Frost trolls often adorn themselves with trophies of bone and hide flayed from their kills.Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager’s stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls’ capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand—a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies.
The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures’ power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll’s vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though—even the smallest scrap of a troll’s flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster’s entire body until nothing remains.
Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such “troll kings” possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well—mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous— but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood.
Particularly devout trolls, called augurs, claim to possess the so‑called “gift of sight,” which they believe was granted them by the demon lord Urxehl. Augurs practice a disturbing method of future‑telling, in which a troll slashes open its own abdomen and pulls out its entrails to interpret the prophecies in its quivering innards. Other cultists prod and agitate their gutted diviner to keep it conscious throughout the gruesome ordeal.
The blood of trolls is a valuable and difficult-to-procure substance of intense interest to alchemists, witches, and doctors the world over. Though initially it is of little interest other than its unnaturally vibrant hue, when processed correctly its applications are numerous. Experiments have produced oils that restore lost limbs, potions that grant the imbiber supernatural strength, and even smoke bombs that cause anyone caught in the haze to fly into an unstoppable rage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Frost Worm.
The frost worm's single round, red eye gleams prominently at the head of its monstrous mass, white as a winter snowfall. What appears to be a bifurcated lower jaw is actually two spiky parapodia that the worm uses to shovel food into its lamprey-like mouth. An adult frost worm measures 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.
A frost worm is an apex predator that uses camouflage, burrowing, and deceit to ambush its prey. When it attacks, a frost worm produces a distinctive, high-pitched trill. Though some survivors of frost worm attacks have compared it to a wailing lament, the trill has a captivating effect on nearby creatures, causing them to stop and listen even as the monstrous creature approaches.
The cold shed by a frost worm is as dangerous as its trill or its jaws, and while it is not fond of warmer climates, neither is it particularly hampered in such regions. A frost worm that somehow finds itself in temperate or even tropical environs causes the immediate area to chill and ice over with frost over time, creating seemingly impossible pockets of frozen terrain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Frost Yai.
Ice yai combine the brutality of frost giants with the grace of martial artists. More than any other oni, ice yai delight not in the pleasures of the flesh, but in flesh itself—rather than indulging in oft-destructive mortal vices like drink or lust, ice yai pursue physical perfection, reveling in the process of turning their bodies into powerful fighting machines.
When an oni manifests, they always do so in a form that parodies a specific humanoid ancestry closely associated with the oni’s obsessions and envies. Giants’ over-the-top personalities and sizes are likely the reason why these humanoids are the most common incarnations chosen by oni; such oni are known collectively as yai oni. Yet there exist oni associated with almost every kind of humanoid. Most oni are capable of supernaturally disguising themselves as their associated humanoid type and use this ability to infiltrate societies and seize control from within. Once established, oni typically reveal their true form and revel in dominating those they view as lesser beings fit only to serve their whims.
Oni are nothing if not vain. They typically choose comely or striking appearances in their humanoid disguises—forms that are completely at odds with the ugliness of their true natures. An oni’s true form is indicative of their innermost desires and always has features such as oversized teeth that verge into tusks, sharp claws, unusually bright skin colors, or a third eye in the forehead. Oni have desires as varied as those of any being, though by their nature these desires are almost always for hedonistic or destructive experiences of the flesh, typically food, pleasure, or violence.
Oni daimyo are quasi-deities with isolated mortal domains. The most powerful is Inma, the Empress of the World, but Akuma the Horned King, Murona the Dark Mother, and Nataka the Red King are also worshipped.
The first oni originated in the nation of Minkai on the continent of Tian Xia. Whether due to prevalent local kami— particularly in the mist-shrouded Forest of Spirits—or its peoples' faiths, Minkai is a hotbed of oni activity.
Oni humanoid forms are limited to one specific appearance. An ogre magecan assume only one specific ogre form, while an ice yai can appear only as one specific frost giant. Some oni have greater control over their shapeshifting power and can assume the form of any humanoid creature, and these oni tend to be the most dangerous.
Different oni exist for nearly every humanoid ancestry. Kuwa oni mask their golden skin and four-fingered claws in human form, while ja oni hide as hobgoblins. Other yai include wind yai (who take their form from cloud giants) and the immensely powerful void yai (who form from other yai and ascend to rule over rune giants).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Fuming Sludge.
The slurry from alchemical experiments is often as flammable as it is toxic. In especially volatile cases, a fuming sludge can form from ignited pools of unstable alchemical runoff. It resembles a charcoal-colored slurry studded with tiny embers, and it continually emits a thin haze of accelerant that amplifies the fires it starts.
A fuming sludge must consume the base chemicals of living creatures to survive and can instinctively identify the complex molecules found in most animate creatures. The first meal of many a fuming sludge is its accidental creator, but it soon moves on to hunt in lush forests or densely populated settlements. A fuming sludge can extrude a powerful pseudopod to strike its victims, but it can also eject portions of its body with peristaltic contractions. These rapidly-cooling globs of goo slow down fleeing prey, but the cold, crusty residue can also alert canny explorers to their presence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Fungus Leshy.
Fungus leshys guard caves, bogs, and damp, dark places. Their fungus gardens are bizarre by most standards, but fungus leshys are extremely proud of their works.
Because of their relative frailty, leaf leshys frequently act as liaisons and call upon more powerful forest guardians when their domains are threatened. Nymphs, sprites, and other goodly fey may respond to the call of a leaf leshy, as do arboreals and other plant creatures.
When a leshy dies, its body explodes in a wave of vegetation as its spirit returns to the natural world. Though leshy spirits that are called into new bodies after death typically keep only vague recollections of their pasts, they retain many of the values and habits of their former life.
Leshys are fairly egalitarian when interacting with their own kind. Most communities are meritocracies, rewarding leshys who defend their communities and help each other succeed, and they see working together as the best path to a successful future.
Occasionally, a leshy proves so valuable to their community that they're uplifted as a hero. These admired leshys are not all warriors; outstanding artisans, caretakers, or diplomats might also be lauded as heroes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gahlepod (Juvenile Brughadatch).
The youngest brughadatches resemble overlarge tadpoles about 2 feet long.
Brughadatches of all life stages tend to cohabitate, since their abilities naturally synergize and tip the odds of survival in their favor. A single brughadatch elder—known as a doblagub—leads a clan, while midlife brughadatches serve as scouts, hunters, and laborers. Gahlepods dwell in large, stagnant ponds and bogs around the brughadatches’ holdings, so they are often the first to interact with creatures that carelessly wander into their domain. Adventurers who make it past these bogs often fail to realize the connection between the gahlepods and the amphibious tricksters further on in the swamp until they encounter the doblagub, who is now roused and commands their brethren in battle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gancanagh (Passion Azata).
Gancanaghs are lovers, revelers, and dashing duelists of Elysium. Embodiments of free love, they eagerly throw themselves into courting targets for brief but earnest flings until their quicksilver passions change their desires. They serve Cayden Cailean as well as other bacchanalian deities and empyreal lords of Elysium who understand their desires for love and parties. Gancanaghs hate evil beings that profane the spirit of romance and passion, as such creatures (especially the demonic tempters known as succubi) reinforce stigmas against open and free love. One can give no greater insult to a gancanagh than to mistake him for such a creature, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed paladin or other champion of good to a duel over such a slight. While they enjoy drinking and carousing, gancanaghs can’t stand smoke. Nonetheless, many gancanaghs carry whimsical-looking smoking pipes because they think it makes them look dapper. They cherish their silver flutes, for they enjoy the beauty of flutes’ music and its ability to sway the heart.
The majority of gancanaghs present themselves as male, but the concept of gender to a creature like a gancanagh, which can change its shape freely, is much more fluid and open to interpretation than for many mortals. Gancanaghs enjoy using this flexibility to confront and test mortals’ convictions when faced with fear or prejudice, but when encountering mortals who themselves are open-minded about sexuality or gender identity, they can become lifelong allies. For those who are persecuted for such reasons, gancanaghs are tireless defenders and eager supporters, quick to provide safety and to punish those who would attempt to impose narrower beliefs upon a world that deserves more diversity than it often gets. If possible, a gancanagh seeks to educate and redeem those who hold destructive beliefs or prejudices, resorting to combat only to defend themself or an endangered mortal, or when no other option seems tenable—yet even then, they fight with sadness.
The most powerful of all azatas belong to the cast of demigods known as empyreal lords. These lesser deities maintain many cults across many Material Plane worlds, and count among their kind such diverse demigods as Ashava, a protector of lost spirits and dancer in the moonlight; Black Butterfly, a mysterious agent of Desna and patron of the depths of outer space; and Sinashakti, joyful wanderer and deliverer of wisdom to vagabonds.
While azatas would like to think they are above material wealth, the truth is that most azatas adore finery and displays of beauty or grandeur. They might explain away bejeweled weapons as necessary tools against the forces of evil, or the wild array of jewelry and silks they wear as important diplomatic tools.
The wilds of Elysium play host to a wide array of azatas, the most varied and widespread of the celestials. From the four-eyed mothlike uinuja to the supernaturally verdant and beautiful veranallia, whose lower body is a wondrous garden of wildflowers and plant life, azatas are nothing if not diverse!
While the idyllic realm of Elysium is the home plane of azatas, their overwhelming curiosity and natural wanderlust often lead them to travel far from this plane. On other planes, they can be seeking to right wrongs, looking for entertainment, or merely exploring to see the sights. More than a few azatas, taken by a whimsical urge to spread their sometimes unwelcome jocosity, see it as their duty to tease uptight or humorless mortal creatures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gargoyle.
Gargoyles are monstrous hunters made of elemental stone. They use their resemblance to decorative statues to hide in plain sight in cities during the day and descend upon unlucky pedestrians at night. Their most common form is that of a horned humanoid with bat-like wings, but individual gargoyles show a great deal of variation, with some appearing more or less humanoid and others resembling no known creature. A gargoyle’s features are not flxed; city-dwelling gargoyles who remain in the same locale long enough slowly morph, day by day, to match the style of the local architecture. These patient monsters can stay disguised for long stretches of time as they patiently await an opportunity to strike.
Gargoyles tend to be lone hunters, though sometimes they band into fearsome tribes called “wings” for protection or sport. On rare occasions, wings become relatively stable communities, and gargoyles in wings may even ally with other creatures such as demons and intelligent aberrations, though these alliances exist on a razor’s edge. The majority of gargoyles are treacherous, vindictive, and petty—traits that preclude lasting partnerships. Many tend to be obsessive and compulsive. Some are collectors, focusing on anything from books to grim trophies, while others are ritualistic or overly passionate about niche intellectual subjects or certain artistic motifs. These tendencies often contribute to the dissolution of wings as individuals’ obsessions and compulsions clash. Kapoacinth Kapoacinths dwell not amid cliffs or rooftops, but beneath the sea, using their wings to swim. These water-dwelling gargoyles often dwell in shallow coastal regions and shamble forth from the sea to attack prey. Kapoacinths are less individualistic and tend to create more stable wings for longer periods of time. Kapoacinths have the same abilities as the gargoyle presented below, but with the following adjustments: they have the aquatic trait, they have a swim Speed of 40 feet instead of a fly Speed, and their Clawed Feat reaction triggers when they are Swimming instead of Flying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gashadokuro.
The dreaded gashadokuro is an undead haunter of the night, a giant skeleton that rises from the earth in the aftermath of a mass starvation event and seeks to inflict its unending hunger on the living.
A gashadokuro that comes about due to a poor growing season is more prone to stalk remote village farmlands at night, while a gashadokuro that arose from the victims of a government-instigated food shortage has few compunctions about stomping straight into bustling cities in broad daylight. These latter gashadokuro even seem to target aristocrats and government authorities—whether or not they are the same politicians whose negligence resulted in the famine in the first place—leading many to believe that the gashadokuro seeks to slake its thirst for revenge even more than it seeks to sate its unending hunger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gelatinous Cube.
Found underground or in dungeons, these quivering cubes of slime continuously scour their domain for food. The acid in their bodies is weak enough that many gelatinous cubes still contain the gear of their victims, as they’re unable to break them down.
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms are usually found near each other, as the two oozes are part of the same life cycle. When a giant amoeba grows large enough, it can spontaneously split apart into two separate amoeba swarms, and when an amoeba swarm feeds enough, its individual components can fuse together into a single creature.
Many oozes have acidic attacks that can quickly degrade flesh, wood, and even stronger materials. Some believe that oozes are the result of alchemical or magical experimentation run amok, while others postulate that they simply emerged from the natural processes of evolution.
Many varieties of these nearly mindless predators exist in the world. Some are mere variants, with different colored puddings, jellies, and oozes with little to differentiate them from those presented here other than their habitat. Others are more specialized, or even dangerously intelligent. The shoggoth is one such example, but another variety of deadly and powerful ooze is the thankfully rare blight, a creature composed of protoplasm and eyes that curses entire regions with its presence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gelugon (Ice Devil).
Insectile ice devils are strategists and masterminds in Hell’s armies, using their superior intellect to strike against their enemies and spread Hell’s influence throughout the planes. An ice devil rarely breaks their solitary contemplation of strategy save to pursue a plan they have devised. They can be enticed otherwise only by an exchange of services to be determined at a later time, adding to the pieces they can play on the board. Occasionally, a mortal strategist of outstanding skill might amuse an ice devil enough for the gelugon to agree to a contest of strategy, typically a strategic board game like chess, to decide a dispute. In the unlikely event the devil loses such a contest, they inevitably go to great lengths to later obtain that mortal’s services for their own infernal ends.
At any one time, eight archdevils rule the eight upper layers of Hell, while the deepest layer is ruled by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a unique demigod with a dedicated role in guiding the infernal machine forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city. Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries, and Belial designs new weapons for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the oldest archdevil and keeper of many secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs armies. Baalzebul is a brooding archdevil who has fallen from Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty Mephistopheles was formed from the plane of Hell itself.
Many unique and powerful devils hold positions of power in Hell. The most numerous of these are the infernal dukes, many of whom were promoted to this position from already impressive statures as pit fiends. The supreme ruler of Hell itself is Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness. Between these two tiers rule the eight archdevils—see the sidebar on the facing page.
The nine layers of Hell are the planar home of all devils, and they much prefer its tyrannically ordered environs to anywhere else in the multiverse. Yet devils can be encountered anywhere mortals can be tempted by infernal bargains or seek diabolic aid. On Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is particularly aligned with Hell. Its government is based upon Hellʼs organization, and the state church is that of Asmodeus.
Devils view daemonsʼ constant hunt for souls as a short-sighted waste of potential, and demonsʼ chaotic destruction of society and flesh as uncivilized and obnoxious, but they do not loathe their fiendish counterparts. Indeed, most devils are more than willing to take advantage of daemons and demons as they can to further their own machinations.
Stinking, sulfurous hellfire is infused with evil. Hellfire always deals a combination of fire damage and evil damage, though the specific ratio depends on the hellfire's origin. Certain types of hellfire can impose other effects on creatures as well, such as sapping their strength or memories.
While travel to and from Hell is possible with plane shift, another way to reach and traverse the infernal realms is via hellmouths, strange living portals connecting different layers or even different planes. A hellmouth takes the form of a grimacing face, distended maw, or other distressingly organic aperture, and no two share the same appearance. Most are carefully guarded, but some new or well-hidden hellmouths have yet to be discovered.
The devils presented on these pages are a small sampling of the torments Hell has to offer. Other devils, like the inquisition-focused bone devils, the cherub-faced and fly-bodied accuser devils, and the aquatic drowning devil are a few examples of these widespread immortal creatures.
The four queens of the night wield great power in the Pit. Ardad Lili is a plotter and manipulator with ambitions of ruling the heavens, while Doloras revels in suffering. Most distant is Mahathallah, watching over fate and death. Mightiest among them is Eiseth, who is assembling an army in Dis in the hopes of claiming the iron throne of Malebolge.
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little use for compassion or empathy. As such, it exists entirely within a strict hierarchy, and this order extends to its denizens. While different types of demons correspond to various sins and daemons are associated with modes of mortal death, the different types of devils exist solely to fulfill particular roles in the infernal machine. On occasion, a particular devil can transcend the role for which they were literally shaped, but this often transforms the devil physically into the type suitable for their new role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ghaele (Crusader Azata).
Ghaeles are fiend-hunting knights of Elysium and champions of the freedom to take up arms against oppressors and other evils. Ghaeles rarely engage directly in mortal wars, but where fiends are involved they make an exception. A ghaele might assume the guise of a mortal to fight fiends alongside others, hoping to bolster morale and teach good tactics against such supernatural foes. Ghaeles serve various deities and empyreal lords of Elysium, though many have an affinity for Cayden Cailean in his capacity as a champion of freedom and defender of the downtrodden. Among azatas, ghaeles are generally the quickest to shift to violence as a method of solving problems, but even then they seek to minimize pain and suffering when they can.
The most powerful of all azatas belong to the cast of demigods known as empyreal lords. These lesser deities maintain many cults across many Material Plane worlds, and count among their kind such diverse demigods as Ashava, a protector of lost spirits and dancer in the moonlight; Black Butterfly, a mysterious agent of Desna and patron of the depths of outer space; and Sinashakti, joyful wanderer and deliverer of wisdom to vagabonds.
While azatas would like to think they are above material wealth, the truth is that most azatas adore finery and displays of beauty or grandeur.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Ghast.
Ghasts—feral, foul-smelling, and constantly hungry—are the more powerful kin of ghouls. They are relentless in the pursuit of their prey.
You can turn a living creature into a ghoul by completing the following steps. When creating a ghast, double these numerical adjustments. The monsters in this section are built from the ground up, so their numbers don't match these guidelines exactly. Custom-building ghouls is recommended if you have time, using the special abilities listed here but creating the other statistics to match what you want the ghoul to be. First, increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. Increase its AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If the creature is limited in how often it can use an ability (such as a breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.
A ghoul gains the undead and ghoul traits, and it usually becomes evil. If the base creature has any abilities that come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghoul. All ghouls gain the following abilities. The save DC for all abilities uses the DC of the ghoul's level.
Darkvision
Negative Healing
Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious
Claws If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus paralysis). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.
Jaws If the creature had a mouth, it gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus ghoul fever and paralysis). The damage amount should be the same as the creature's non-agile attacks.
Consume Flesh (manipulate) Requirements The ghoul is adjacent to the corpse of a creature that died within the last hour. Effect The ghoul devours a chunk of the corpse and regains 1d6 Hit Points plus 1d6 for every 2 levels it has. It can regain Hit Points from any given corpse only once.
Ghoul Fever (disease) Saving Throw Fortitude; Stage 1 carrier with no ill effect (1 day); Stage 2 2d6 negative damage and regains half as many Hit Points from all healing (1 day); Stage 3 as stage 2 (1 day); Stage 4 2d6 negative damage and gains no benefit from healing (1 day); Stage 5 as stage 4 (1 day); Stage 6 dead, and rises as a ghoul the next midnight.
Paralysis (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) Any living, non-elf creature hit by a ghoul's attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or become paralyzed. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.
Swift Leap (move) The ghoul jumps up to half its Speed. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ghonhatine.
In transforming xulgaths, drow fleshwarpers sought not to create a new type of creature but to recapture a form of xulgath predecessor believed entirely vanished from Golarion. Ghonhatines are the result—hulking reptilian beasts who prefer to crawl on all fours and tear at their foes with bestial fury.
Not every fleshwarp emerges from its vat capable of survival. Many perish within minutes, as organs fundamental for life simply fail or collapse in on themselves. Fleshwarpers can usually recycle failed fleshwarps back into the mix quickly enough, but now and then, remnants known as fleshdregs are stable enough to live pain-wracked lives of their own. These foul creatures often infest fleshwarper holdings, like rats or other vermin do in less awful locations.
Grothluts may be the weakest example of a fleshwarp, and driders the most successful, but others exist as well. Ghonhatines are lumbering fleshwarps formed from xulgaths, while the tentacled irnakurses are formed from surface-dwelling elves. Sinspawn are fleshwarps as well, of course, although their methods of creation differ drastically from the techniques mastered by drow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ghost Commoner.
The ghost commoner is an ordinary person who believes they died unjustly, usually due to foul play or betrayal.
While it's best to create custom ghosts to fill an adventure's specific needs, you can also use the following guidelines to turn existing living creatures into ghosts.
First, increase the creature's level by 2 and change its statistics as follows. Increase AC, saves, Perception, DCs, and skill modifiers by 2. Increase the most appropriate melee attack modifier by 4 to become ghostly hand (described below), and other attack modifiers by 2. A ghost has a Strength modifier of –5 and a Constitution modifier of +0. Do not modify the ghost's Hit Points due to its new level.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ghost Mage.
A wizard who died with a major project left undone might become a ghost mage, constantly seeking to finish its task in undeath.
While it's best to create custom ghosts to fill an adventure's specific needs, you can also use the following guidelines to turn existing living creatures into ghosts.
First, increase the creature's level by 2 and change its statistics as follows. Increase AC, saves, Perception, DCs, and skill modifiers by 2. Increase the most appropriate melee attack modifier by 4 to become ghostly hand (described below), and other attack modifiers by 2. A ghost has a Strength modifier of –5 and a Constitution modifier of +0. Do not modify the ghost's Hit Points due to its new level.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ghoul.
Ghouls are ravenous undead who haunt graveyards and eat corpses.
You can turn a living creature into a ghoul by completing the following steps. When creating a ghast, double these numerical adjustments. The monsters in this section are built from the ground up, so their numbers don't match these guidelines exactly. Custom-building ghouls is recommended if you have time, using the special abilities listed here but creating the other statistics to match what you want the ghoul to be. First, increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. Increase its AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If the creature is limited in how often it can use an ability (such as a breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.
A ghoul gains the undead and ghoul traits, and it usually becomes evil. If the base creature has any abilities that come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghoul. All ghouls gain the following abilities. The save DC for all abilities uses the DC of the ghoul's level.
Darkvision
Negative Healing
Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious
Claws If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus paralysis). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.
Jaws If the creature had a mouth, it gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus ghoul fever and paralysis). The damage amount should be the same as the creature's non-agile attacks.
Consume Flesh (manipulate) Requirements The ghoul is adjacent to the corpse of a creature that died within the last hour. Effect The ghoul devours a chunk of the corpse and regains 1d6 Hit Points plus 1d6 for every 2 levels it has. It can regain Hit Points from any given corpse only once.
Ghoul Fever (disease) Saving Throw Fortitude; Stage 1 carrier with no ill effect (1 day); Stage 2 2d6 negative damage and regains half as many Hit Points from all healing (1 day); Stage 3 as stage 2 (1 day); Stage 4 2d6 negative damage and gains no benefit from healing (1 day); Stage 5 as stage 4 (1 day); Stage 6 dead, and rises as a ghoul the next midnight.
Paralysis (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) Any living, non-elf creature hit by a ghoul's attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or become paralyzed. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.
Swift Leap (move) The ghoul jumps up to half its Speed. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Amoeba.
These blobs of nearly transparent protoplasm are identical in form and behavior to the microscopic creatures from which they have evolved, except their outlandish size makes them all the more dangerous. Unlike slimes, puddings, and other deadly oozes, giant amoebas have an outer membrane that contains their internal structures, making them more susceptible to slashing weapons than their amorphous kin. However, this membrane is also extremely flexible and permeable, allowing them to surround prey and absorb it, suffocating and slowly digesting it in the amoeba's acidic fluids.
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms are usually found near each other, as the two oozes are part of the same life cycle. When a giant amoeba grows large enough, it can spontaneously split apart into two separate amoeba swarms, and when an amoeba swarm feeds enough, its individual components can fuse together into a single creature.
Many oozes have acidic attacks that can quickly degrade flesh, wood, and even stronger materials. Some believe that oozes are the result of alchemical or magical experimentation run amok, while others postulate that they simply emerged from the natural processes of evolution.
Many varieties of these nearly mindless predators exist in the world. Some are mere variants, with different colored puddings, jellies, and oozes with little to differentiate them from those presented here other than their habitat. Others are more specialized, or even dangerously intelligent. The shoggoth is one such example, but another variety of deadly and powerful ooze is the thankfully rare blight, a creature composed of protoplasm and eyes that curses entire regions with its presence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Anaconda.
The monstrous giant anaconda is capable of swallowing whole creatures as big as horses—to say nothing of their riders. Although novice bushwhackers watch out for snakes that might drop on them from the jungle canopy above, giant anacondas are most commonly encountered in ponds and rivers, where they feed on prey including manatees and capybaras.
Snakes of all sorts eat their meals by devouring their prey whole. After incapacitating a creature, a snake unhinges its jaw and consumes the creature entirely, even if it's more than twice the diameter of the snake's body. A snake can consume a creature of the same size as itself or smaller, but most snakes are logy and sluggish while the meal digests.
Snakeskin's distinctive pattern and wide variety of applications makes it a sought-after resource, and the hides of extra-large snakes such as giant anacondas can fetch a fine price in the right market. Such oversized snake hides can be used to craft clothing of snakeskin leather, including boots and gloves, as well as other items such as scabbards, backpacks, and even tents or makeshift boats. A snake's hide can be cleanly removed with a successful Crafting check or appropriate Lore check.
Snakes appear frequently and prominently in the myths and legends of many cultures throughout the Inner Sea region. In Ancient Osirion, snakes were revered and associated both with the evil serpent god Apep and the good goddess Wadjet, the Green Empress. Perhaps the best-known example of snakes in Golarion's legends are the serpentfolk— serpentine humanoids who ruled vast swaths of the world in prehistoric times and worshipped a foul snake deity called Ydersius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Animated Statue.
As with any humanoid animated statues of Medium size, giant animated statues are used to guard locations of importance, but their increased size and power make them most useful in large vaults, spacious chambers, or outdoor locations. Animated objects of this strength and size are ideal for tasks and responsibilities usually performed by golems, and more powerful animated objects are thus all but unheard of.
Most animated objects encountered by adventurers are permanently animated creatures, either created by rituals or given life by infusions of positive energy. Restless spirits, certain ghosts, and other haunting undead influences can also give rise to animated objects, although in cases like the poltergeist, what appears to be an animated object may merely be an evil force using its magic to hurl furnishings about as weapons.
Animated objects are mindless constructs. While this leaves them no concept of the value of treasure, they are often used as guardians for vaults or repositories of valuables. In these cases, the treasures they guard can vary wildly, but should be of a value appropriate for the animated object’s level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Ant.
Giant ants are much like their smaller kin in their industrious habits, though growing to the size of ponies makes them much deadlier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Aukashungi.
The strongest individual in an aukashungi swarm eventually grows to monstrous proportions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Badger.
The violent, territorial giant badger is a relentless predator. An obligate carnivore, its prey ranges from rabbits to deer, livestock, and even the occasional traveler or adventurer. A giant badger's claws are sharp and strong enough to carve tunnels from solid rock. They typically stand 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh 500 pounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Bat.
While big bats are certainly not uncommon in dark caves and abandoned ruins and may instill fear in squeamish spelunkers, the so-called giant bat is a true monster, weighing well over 100 pounds and having a wingspan of nearly 15 feet. It primarily eats fruit and bugs, but can be incited to violence through fear or hunger. Giant bat attacks can quickly give rise to rumors of more dangerous monsters—many mistake these massive animals for some sort of demon or vampiric monster. But like other bats, giant bats are simply social and intelligent mammals. They are sometimes used as mounts by smaller humanoids, commonly those who hail from or dwell in mountainous or underground regions.
Vampire bat swarms roost in colonies wherever they can find shelter from weather, light, and predators, favoring caves, trees, and narrow gorges. Giant bats prefer to dwell in smaller numbers in deep caves, abandoned mines, or the attics of abandoned buildings. Even larger species dwell in the deeper regions of the Darklands, where they are often used as mounts, or even ritualistically slaughtered and then animated as specialized undead guardians of eerie underground cities and nations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Bone Skipper.
While less common than the smaller variety, giant bone skippers are the stuff of nightmares for morticians and graveyard keepers.
Bone skippers eat and breed within the bones of deceased megafauna, such as elephants and teraphants. In areas where their carcasses are rare or quickly disposed of, bone skippers are virtually unknown. Sufficiently large undead creatures, like zombie hulks, might harbor a bone skipper swarm that buzzes around them, defending their gruesome “lairs.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Centipede.
Most giant centipedes (known as sewer centipedes when found in cities) nest in small groups but hunt alone when they seek out food. Attempts to domesticate giant centipedes for use as guardians or pets generally end poorly, but some tribes of goblins, kobolds, and mitflits have developed effective methods of utilizing these vermin as guardians. Other tribes and some humanoid societies roast and eat centipedes, often with pungent peppers as a savory delicacy, although care must be taken in preparing the meal to avoid tainting the flesh with the creature’s venom.
Centipedes take nearly countless forms amid nearly every climate, with specific traits and abilities varying wildly between species. Tangled forests, arid deserts, foul sewers, deep caverns, and abandoned buildings are all common haunts for centipedes, from oversized specimens capable of taking down significant prey alone to carpets of frenzied vermin gathered into a dangerous swarm. Larger and more specialized centipedes than the two presented here exist, such as the sleek giant whiptail centipede or the immense titan centipede.
All centipedes prefer to eat carrion, gathering in numbers around large corpses or battlefields and jealously guarding their troves of flesh from any who would disturb them. Monstrous centipedes are also aggressive hunters and are particularly fond of devouring horses and similar creatures, often snatching a mount right out from under its rider. They are unusually stealthy for creatures of their size, making their swift strikes all the more frightening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Chameleon.
Giant chameleons are legendary for their ability to change their skin color in response to their surroundings. Their eyes are capable of peering in different directions independently, making them almost as difficult to sneak up on as they are to notice in the first place.
Giant lizards can be found in all temperate or tropical climates, often in relatively close proximity to smaller villages or rural regions where they can be a dangerous threat to livestock or travelers. The two lizards presented here tend to dwell in warmer regions— jungles for giant chameleons, and savannas for megalanias.
Giant lizards are often used as mounts or guardians or kept as pets, but never so often or as traditionally as they are by lizardfolk. The kinship these people share with giant lizards is unmistakable, valuing their companionship to an extent that equals or even exceeds that which other societies have for popular animal companions like dogs and horses.
The three species of giant lizard presented here are but the most common of their kind encountered in the wilds. Stories of much larger lizards persist, including the immense, 20-foot-long monster known as a megalania, a truly enormous version of the giant monitor lizard capable of swallowing creatures whole. Less dangerous is the giant chameleon, although its ability to blend into its environs makes it a much more insidious and stealthy threat than the lumbering, mighty megalania.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Cockroach.
Cockroaches are communal creatures, rarely setting out on their own unless they are searching for food. If an adventurer encounters a single giant cockroach while exploring, they had best take precautions against others, as there is likely an entire colony nearby.
Beyond the common giant cockroach, other flesh-eating cockroaches exist throughout the world. These variations include the giant hissing cockroach, the noxious venomroach, the huge spitting cockroach (which can incapacitate enemies from a distance), the aggressive sawback cockroach, and the mysterious and rare dragonroach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Crab.
Crabs are scavenging crustaceans known for their hard shells and iconic sideways gait. They use their claws to defend themselves, hunt, and fight other crabs for territory. When confronted with threats from outside their species, most crabs prefer to flee, but when retreat isn't possible, they clamp on to their foes as tightly as they can.
The statistics presented here represent giant crabs that live close to the water's surface. Crabs that live deeper underwater often exhibit more extreme adaptations to their environment. Crabs who live in the depths where little light reaches gain darkvision and cold resistance, and those adapted to the most hostile reaches of the deep sea can detect nearby creatures through subtle shifts in ocean currents.
These skittering creatures are prized for their delicious meat, but their size makes them dangerous targets for harvesting.
Crabs can be found along all of the world's coastlines, from relatively small creatures like the king crab or the coconut crab, to truly oversized monsters like the great reef crab, shark-eating crab, or the lumbering shipwrecker crab.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Crawling Hand.
A giant crawling hand is the appendage of a very large creature, such as a giant.
A popular tale among necromancers tells of an ancient wizard who trafficked in evil magic. During a summoning ritual gone wrong, the wizard's hand became possessed and later strangled them while they slept. The hand dragged the corpse across the wizard's rooms to their workbench, propped up a knife in a vise, and severed itself from the rest of the body. According to the story, the hand went on to commit several more murders and disappeared into the sewers of a major metropolis, never to be seen again. Some necromancers believe that this original crawling hand still creeps through the shadows of that city, killing as it pleases<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Dragonfly.
These buzzing insects are the size of a small horse. They are ambush predators known to hunt beasts and humanoids alike, capable of using impressive aerial acrobatics to swoop down from above and snatch away their prey.
While dragonflies come in many colors, the differences between species sometimes extend beyond aesthetic variation. Giant blue dragonflies are larger toxic versions of the insects with a numbing bite that boggards use to craft poisons. Cave dragonflies are slower but stronger variants that dwell in large cavern systems. The legendary storm dragonflies are truly immense creatures that can use their powerful wings to stun foes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Dragonfly Nymph.
The aquatic, wingless offspring of dragonflies are called dragonfly nymphs. Giant dragonfly nymphs can be several feet in length and mostly hunt in shallow waters, eating carrion and ambushing living creatures with their fully grown counterparts. They are not daunted by larger creatures, compelled by their instinct to eat as much as possible to sustain their growth.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Eagle.
No mere animals, giant eagles have a keen intellect and a strong sense of honor. As guardians of their mountain homes, giant eagles attempt to prevent the encroachment of civilization upon wild land and the predations of wicked humanoid settlements. Unlike ordinary eagles, which tend to be solitary creatures, giant eagles congregate within aeries holding up to a dozen members and work together to protect their domains.
Giant eagles have wingspans up to 30 feet across and weigh up to 500 pounds. These impressive birds cannot be easily broken or cowed. A giant eagle may allow trusted terrestrial friends to ride it, but they invariably resist saddles, harnesses, or other equipment that might suggest they are mere beasts of burden rather than trusted companions. Giant eagles are long-lived and take debts and oaths very seriously, often remembering slights for years and remaining slow to forgive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Flea.
Giant fleas are commonly found in areas containing hardy megafauna, such as dinosaurs or mammoths.
Flea swarms and giant fleas make for natural pets and monstrous minions for creatures who live in areas of filth and concentrated populations. Goblins and gremlins are unperturbed by fleas’ disturbing physiologies and are unfazed (though not necessarily unaffected) by the diseases these vermin carry. Ratfolk have been known to tame giant fleas for use as mounts, and urban-dwelling druids whose magic focuses on blight or disease naturally find much to like about the flea swarms they frequently summon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Fly.
This pony-sized fly's twitching limbs seem to never stop moving as it constantly cleans itself and scoops anything edible into its mouthparts. While primarily carrion eaters, giant flies sometimes prey on livestock or other animals too slow to get away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Flytrap.
Because they blend in so well with surrounding foliage, giant flytraps can use the element of surprise to make quick strikes against unsuspecting adventurers and forest travelers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Frilled Lizard.
Found in warm and tropical forests and savannas, these immense lizards are a deadly threat to the unsuspecting traveler. When they aren’t sleeping or stalking prey, giant frilled lizards bask in the sunlight for hours at a time. Explorers sometimes mistakenly think them related to dragons due to their large size, elaborate neck frills (which, when displayed in a show of aggression and dominance, can be mistaken for wings), and ferocious hissing vocalizations used to frighten away creatures too large to eat.
A giant frilled lizard’s primary food sources are oversized arthropods and other invertebrates, but it won’t hesitate to augment its diet with vertebrates, including other lizards, monkeys, and just about anything it can flt into its mouth—even humanoids. Although capable of short bursts of speed, a giant frilled lizard normally lies perfectly still while hunting, hoping to ambush its prey.
Giant lizards can be found in all temperate or tropical climates, often in relatively close proximity to smaller villages or rural regions where they can be a dangerous threat to livestock or travelers. The two lizards presented here tend to dwell in warmer regions— jungles for giant chameleons, and savannas for megalanias.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Frog.
Giant frogs can grow up to 6 feet long and weigh over 200 pounds, with rows of razor-sharp teeth lining their gaping mouths.
While all frogs are amphibious, some frogs spend more of their time out of the water. Even those usually found near lakes and streams are adapted for climbing. You can add variety to frog encounters by replacing a frog's swim Speed with a climb Speed (or even allowing it to have both). Likewise, for frogs that are poisonous or venomous, the specific effects of their toxin can vary by species, with exposure to some frog poison causing a creature to become clumsy or stupefied instead of enfeebled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Gecko.
These roughly human-sized reptiles have amazing feet capable of clinging tenaciously to any surface. Giant geckos are typically docile and shy but can be aggressive when cornered or defending their territory. These large-eyed lizards are found in a wide variety of habitats, from rainforests and deserts to mountain slopes or even underground caverns. They spend most of their time climbing around in large trees or on rocky cliffs, whether hunting for small animals or hiding from predators. A giant gecko’s scales are often quite brightly colored or decorated in intricate patterns. Giant geckos span nearly 8 feet in length from head to tail, and they weigh about 120 pounds.
Giant geckos are sometimes used by smaller humanoids as guardians or mounts, as their docile nature makes them relatively easy to tame and train. Their superior climbing skills make giant geckos particularly popular within societies that dwell underground or near cliffs, such as goblins and kobolds. Their bright coloration also makes them favorite exotic pets in high society.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Hippocampus.
Living in the deepest reaches of the ocean, giant hippocampi haven't been sighted near the shore and are often regarded as legends made up by sailors.
Hippocampi are highly prized by undersea societies and surface dwellers alike, as they are as easy to train as horses and serve many of the same functions, be that as beasts of burden, war-trained mounts, transportation, or as pets. Though hippocampi are able to wear barding, it hampers them considerably, so most handlers outfit them with the lightest options available. More often they are trained to pull specially designed underwater chariots or sleds. Hippocampi do not to leave the water, as they are clumsy on land, can’t bear riders while flopping about on the ground, and can’t breathe air for long.
Numerous variant species of hippocampi exist, although most of them differ from the common hippocampus only in coloration. Heartier species, such as polar hippocampi, dwell exclusively in arctic waters and are best presented as hippocampi with elite adjustments.
Protecting the harbor of Absalom and the shores of Starstone Isle, the elite Wave Riders use combat-trained hippocampi as mounts. The Wave Riders harass enemy ships, defend against aquatic foes, and intercept smugglers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Jellyfish.
Unlike its smaller cousins, the giant jellyfish is an active predator that chases down its prey through reefs or open water. It can even squeeze its enormous bell-shaped body into the tight confines of shipwrecks to drape its mane of tentacles across the exposed flesh of its prey.
A large number of types of monstrous jellyfish dwell in the worldfs oceans, each with their own unusual specialty in hunting. The immense vampire jellyfish is a blood-drinking monster that often attacks sailors aboard ships. Among the largest are the dreaded whaler jellyfish, colossal creatures that feed on whales or even krakens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Leech.
Capable of growing to lengths of nearly 5 feet, giant leeches have circular maws filled with hook-like teeth. They prefer to dwell in stagnant or slow-moving shallow water or in damp, moist undergrowth. Horses and larger animals are their favorite prey, but they won't balk at a chance to latch onto a human- or halfling-sized meal.
The spotted hooktooth leech is often found in areas frequented by trolls, who sometimes wear them as awful decorations, relying on their regeneration to control the bleeding effects. The gigantic elephant leech feeds on immense beasts of the swamplands or jungles, like elephants, froghemoths, and dinosaurs, attacking from unexpected range. But it's the relatively small gutleech that provides the most fuel for nightmares, due to its awful habit of feeding on victims from inside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Maggot.
Giant flies lay their eggs on the bodies of larger monsters or livestock. When they hatch, these eggs release squirming maggots the size of human children, ravenous young who voraciously consume any flesh in the immediate vicinity—typically starting with the body upon which they were born.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Mantis.
These massive cousins of normal praying mantises stand taller than an average human. They stalk through dense forests, striking at meals from the trees.
Deadly mantises are sacrosanct to followers of Achaekek, the Mantis God. His adherents, including the infamous Red Mantis assassins, invite or lure deadly mantises close to their settlements, seeing the towering creatures as a sign of their god’s favor. Achaekek’s followers offer sacrifices of livestock or captured enemies to keep the massive insects well fed. Clerics of Achaekek defend a deadly mantis’s territory as if it were their own, believing it to be holy ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Monitor Lizard.
Large and seemingly ponderous, a monitor lizard is a deceptively swift and ruthless predator. It ambushes its prey by rushing out from cover and biting the target with its powerful jaws. A giant monitor lizard’s saliva is venomous, allowing it to bring down prey larger than it can easily haul away in its jaws. Giant monitor lizards grow up to 14 feet long, including their long tails, and they weigh about 350 pounds. Their bodies are normally dark brown with patches of yellow or green. When nesting, a giant monitor lizard digs a deep burrow to hide in. The burrow serves as both a safe haven and a location from which the lizard can ambush larger prey such as deer, boars, or even humanoids. A giant monitor lizard can consume nearly its own body weight in a single meal, and its loosely articulated jaws allow it to swallow surprisingly large prey.
Giant lizards can be found in all temperate or tropical climates, often in relatively close proximity to smaller villages or rural regions where they can be a dangerous threat to livestock or travelers. The two lizards presented here tend to dwell in warmer regions— jungles for giant chameleons, and savannas for megalanias.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Moray Eel.
Giant moray eels dwell in warm, tropical waters and build lairs in narrow, twisting caves made of coral. Their size, speed, and powerful bite make them dangerous to divers and fishermen. Giant moray eels have rubbery hides that secrete a layer of mucus, making them difficult to harm with some weapons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Mosquito.
These horrifically enlarged versions of the common mosquito often prey upon megafauna like dinosaurs and other large creatures, but they won't turn down a chance to drink the blood of a smaller target—such as a humanoid.
This pernicious disease is often associated with mosquitoes. The most common version of malaria is presented on page 118 of the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide, and while the variants inflicted by mosquito swarms and giant mosquitoes are deadlier, they don't have the chance to recur after 1d4 months. Pyrexic malaria also causes weakness and fevers, while septic malaria causes painful and infected lesions to form on the body. Regardless of the strain you contract, you can't reduce your sickened condition while you are affected with malaria.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Octopus.
Giant octopuses are found in the heart of deep, dark oceans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Rat.
Giant rats are enormous versions of the common vermin. They are typically found in abundant numbers, but since they cannot flt in the nooks where mundane rats typically hide, they are much easier to locate and exterminate. They mostly live in sewers where they can scavenge from the streets above, but some families of giant rats live in more remote locations, such as dank caves or forests and hills. Rats are incredibly adept survivors and can be found nearly anywhere in the world, though they tend to favor temperate or warm climates as opposed to cold regions.
Although its bite alone is not lethal except to the very young or very old, the giant rat carries the filth fever common to rodents around the world—a pestilence more than capable of ravaging rural communities.
Rats have a reputation of being vicious, aggressive animals that attack food stores in great numbers and spread disease. While rats are immune to the most severe effects of their own filth fever, the disease makes them unpredictable and aggressive. Some populations of rats carry even more deadly diseases, such as bubonic plague.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Scorpion.
These massive, terrifying arachnids are typically 8 feet long from head to the base of the tail. Giant scorpions are the favored pack animals and war beasts of various desert-dwelling monsters, particularly gnolls. They are most commonly encountered in the wild, however. There they lair in mountainside caves or burrow beneath shallow layers of sand where they lie in wait for prey to wander near. Sleek, pallid subterranean scorpions also exist, as do still larger species.
While scorpions are often symbols of death or evil, their venom can be extracted and used for a wide variety of medical applications. A character can milk an incapacitated giant scorpion to extract raw scorpion venom, which can be used as raw materials to craft giant scorpion venom or lesser antiplague. To determine the value of ingredients you gain each day and the DC of the appropriate Medicine or Lore check, use the level 3 task entry in Table 4–2: Income Earned.
Those rescued from death in the burning sands often recount the same dying vision: a strange, silver-eyed woman whose scarlet silk tents stand on the back of a colossal black scorpion, riding out of a shattered city and leading an army of the dead across a sea of glass toward the world of the living. Millennium-old paintings on the walls of rediscovered tombs depict a similar desert rider. The identity of this red-robed woman is unknown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Snapping Turtle.
If the regular-sized snapping turtle is foul-tempered, then the giant snapping turtle seems to be willfully violent toward anything that dares intrude upon its domain. Measuring over 20 feet long and weighing thousands of pounds, this creature is capable of swallowing a humanoid whole. Swamp-dwelling societies, particularly boggards and lizardfolk, have often tried to domesticate giant snapping turtles to serve as powerful guardians, but in most cases the casualties pile up quickly. Those unfortunate enough to be swallowed whole by a giant snapping turtle find that even the creature's stomach is somewhat armored, making it difficult to cut through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Solifugid.
The smallest of giant solifugids are still large enough to harry desert traders and their mounts.
Most species of solifugid lay their eggs in burrows. The female doesn’t eat while guarding her eggs, and thus fights even more aggressively against any creatures she deems potential threats to her brood. The bodies of wayward adventurers often litter such burrows, though the risks of exploring such treasure-laden nests often deter fortune-hunters from trying their luck with such caches.

The bodies of wayward adventurers often litter such burrows, though this does little to deter other fortune-hunters from trying their luck in such treasure-laden nests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Squid.
Dwelling deep within the oceans, this huge cephalopod grows up to 45 feet in length and can weigh up to 600 pounds. Its arms and tentacles are lined with hundreds of hooks and suckers, allowing it to seize its prey with ease.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Stag Beetle.
The giant stag beetle is larger than a horse, and the sight of one flying (if slowly and somewhat clumsily) on great buzzing wings is unnerving. Its enormous mandibles are used to impress mates, intimidate rivals, and discourage predators, for they can deliver deadly blows. While giant stag beetles are deadly predators, they can be domesticated by skilled wranglers. In such a capacity, these beetles serve well as beasts of burden or even as mounts.
Giant stag beetles can be a serious menace in marshes, cavern complexes, and heavy forests. More than one logging camp has attracted a cluster of giant stag beetles and had to be completely abandoned, yielding all its lumber to the hunger of the giant insects.
Numerous other species of giant beetle exist in the wilds. Duergars train deep-dwelling beetles as mounts and guardians. Bombardier beetles can spew caustic acid as a potent attack. And the truly immense goliath beetles can devastate entire buildings or even castles with frightening ease.
Beetles do not collect treasure, but the two light-producing organs of a flash beetle can be recovered from the creature and used for illumination-based chemical recipes, spell components, and magic item creation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Tarantula.
Tarantulas are ambush predators, but will attack prey in the open.
Though they are vermin incapable of forming true alliances, spiders show up alongside many types of creatures, including web lurkers. Spellcasters sometimes call upon spiders using summon animal, and spider swarms have a way of popping up just about anywhere at the most inopportune times.
A staggering number of species of giant spider exist in the world. Some, like the dream spider, whose venom creates strange hallucinations, are relatively small. Others, like the lumbering ogre spider, are larger than horses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Tick.
This grotesque tick is the size of a dog and scurries with surprising speed.
Giant ticks and tick swarms can potentially inflict diseases other than tick fever. Potential diseases that a tick could spread include blinding sickness, bubonic plague, malaria, or scarlet fever. The saving throw DC should be adjusted to DC 17 (for giant ticks) or DC 27 (for tick swarms).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Toad.
Most giant toads live in dry environments, particularly deserts, and eagerly eat almost any creature smaller than themselves. They're known to eat giant rats, then take over the rats' burrows as homes. Giant toads have large poison glands behind their eyes that enable them to coat their skin with poison. This leads to them having very few natural predators, and populations can quickly explode if left unchecked. While most consider giant toads dangerous pests, some groups of ogres and hill giants cultivate them to collect their poison for recreational use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Viper.
The giant viper’s fangs are a frightening sight, with injection tubes as long as daggers. The sheer amount of venom injected by a giant viper can cause severe blood clotting and leave a victim utterly drained of vitality.
Snakes of all sorts eat their meals by devouring their prey whole. After incapacitating a creature, a snake unhinges its jaw and consumes the creature entirely, even if it's more than twice the diameter of the snake's body. A snake can consume a creature of the same size as itself or smaller, but most snakes are logy and sluggish while the meal digests.
Snakeskin's distinctive pattern and wide variety of applications makes it a sought-after resource, and the hides of extra-large snakes such as giant anacondas can fetch a fine price in the right market. Such oversized snake hides can be used to craft clothing of snakeskin leather, including boots and gloves, as well as other items such as scabbards, backpacks, and even tents or makeshift boats. A snake's hide can be cleanly removed with a successful Crafting check or appropriate Lore check.
Snakes appear frequently and prominently in the myths and legends of many cultures throughout the Inner Sea region. In Ancient Osirion, snakes were revered and associated both with the evil serpent god Apep and the good goddess Wadjet, the Green Empress. Perhaps the best-known example of snakes in Golarion's legends are the serpentfolk— serpentine humanoids who ruled vast swaths of the world in prehistoric times and worshipped a foul snake deity called Ydersius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Wasp.
Giant wasps are much more dangerous but less common than their smaller kin, and—to the relief of those who encounter them—they tend to be solitary.
The poison of the giant wasp loses its potency soon after being harvested, but alchemists have learned of a way to preserve some of its properties by adding a number of harsh additives; this method makes it even deadlier.
Wasps are upheld as sacred among the priesthood of the elven deity Calistria, goddess of vengeance. Some priests of Calistria summon giant wasps or wasp swarms as servitors, while a few nurture giant wasps as pets, temple guardians, or companions. Followers of Calistria, both clergy and laypeople alike, seek to emulate the wasp’s penchant for leaving stung victims alive to suffer over a long period: a fitting model for revenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Whiptail Centipede.
Whiptail centipedes are sleek and swift tunnel predators.
Centipedes take nearly countless forms amid nearly every climate, with specific traits and abilities varying wildly between species. Tangled forests, arid deserts, foul sewers, deep caverns, and abandoned buildings are all common haunts for centipedes, from oversized specimens capable of taking down significant prey alone to carpets of frenzied vermin gathered into a dangerous swarm. Larger and more specialized centipedes than the two presented here exist, such as the sleek giant whiptail centipede or the immense titan centipede.
All centipedes prefer to eat carrion, gathering in numbers around large corpses or battlefields and jealously guarding their troves of flesh from any who would disturb them. Monstrous centipedes are also aggressive hunters and are particularly fond of devouring horses and similar creatures, often snatching a mount right out from under its rider. They are unusually stealthy for creatures of their size, making their swift strikes all the more frightening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Giant Wolverine.
Giant wolverines grow to the approximate size of horses and claim even more expansive territories than their more diminutive wolverine cousins. While a smaller wolverine will defend its prey from armed humanoids, a giant wolverine is unafraid to stalk and kill such creatures.
Wolverines are territorial animals and fiercely defend their kills, even from larger predators or when they're outnumbered. They claim wide swaths of forests or frozen tundra as their territory, marking it with a pungent odor that serves as a warning to those who recognize the smell. Wolverines have voracious appetites and tend to aggressively devour their food with reckless abandon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gibbering Mouther.
Amorphous blobs of yammering mouths and oozing, fleshy sludge, gibbering mouthers are among the strangest creatures found either aboveground or below. Perpetually ravenous, these aberrations are always seeking their next meals, ever eating but never sated. With a nominal intelligence, gibbering mouthers can understand and even speak Aklo, but they do so in an intelligible manner only rarely. Instead, their innumerable mouths constantly jabber and babble in a stream of sound that disrupts the thought patterns of other creatures in the area.
Where, how, and why gibbering mouthers originated are questions without answers. They share certain similarities with the much more powerful shoggoths, leading to theories that the two creatures share an origin; less charitable scholars have suggested that the gibbering mouther is instead a mortal’s attempt to create something akin to a shoggoth—though the question of why remains unanswered. Still others believe gibbering mouthers were sent to the world by the gods as a punishment for some forgotten but surely terrible transgression. Gibbering mouthers themselves have little to say on the matter—at least, not in any sort of sense. Scholars have wasted countless hours in attempts to make sense of gibbering mouthers’ noises—studies that put researchers into danger and give results that are contradictory and confusing at best.
Whatever their origin, gibbering mouthers range the entirety of Golarion. Sightings have been recorded in dungeons below ancient cities and ruins as well as many regions of the deeper Darklands layers of Sekamina and Orv. They are somewhat less common in the upper region of Nar-Voth, perhaps due to the prevalence of settlements that don’t tolerate gibbering mouthers’ presence.
While gibbering mouthers have little interest in treasure, they are known to consume their prey’s valuables along with the creatures’ flesh. Those treasures which are not themselves digestible remain until the gibbering mouther disgorges them or is destroyed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gimmerling.
Gimmerlings are small, shapeshifting fey who stage ambushes to sate their endless hunger and childish greed. These cruelly curious fey obsess over finding and making unusual traps and sadistic weapons, and their favorite amusement is se eing these traps sprung or the weapons wielded. When on the Material Plane, they are frequently found in urban areas, particularly slums or other parts of town where they can either go unnoticed or be easily forgotten—and have plenty of victims to choose from.
A typical gimmerling disguises itself as an endangered child, doing so in hopes of drawing creatures close enough to rob. The gimmerling puts itself in apparent danger using a trap, construct, or bribed ally, or even a coerced monster like a redcap.
Because gimmerlings sometimes trade obscure smithing or trapping techniques in exchange for gifts that sate their curiosity, their greed, or their hunger, they have at times been worshipped as minor gods of the forge. Some disciplined gimmerlings work as honored artisans, elite guards, or spies for the demigods known as the Eldest who dwell in the depths of the First World.
Gimmerlings collect weapons, traps, mechanical novelties, and dangerous magic items. A gimmerling is likely found with tools (like artisan’s tools, repair kits, and thieves’ tools) and items it can use to appear more vulnerable, such as locks, manacles, and snare kits (which it feigns being trapped by).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Glabrezu (Treachery Demon).
Glabrezus are looming behemoths who revel in the act of twisting mortal desires into their ultimate ruin, betraying and manipulating as easily as they breathe. Desires granted by a glabrezu always come to fruition in the most destructive way possible, turning a wish or hope into a potent and devastating act of betrayal—although the long-term repercussions are not always immediately apparent. For example, a struggling weapon smith might wish for fame and skill at their craft, only to find that their best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses the weapons in bloody sprees. Or a lonely widower might have his desire granted in the form of a lost love returned to “life” as a vampire. Glabrezus are nothing if not creative in addressing a mortal’s needs.
These massive demons have enormous pincers and a pair of smaller humanoid arms sprouting from their chests, but their size belies their skill at magic, and they possess formidable innate spells. Treachery demons arise from the souls of mortals engaged in treason and deception.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications. For planar ally, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.
The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.
The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.
Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.
When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.
The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.
The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.
While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.
Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Glass Golem.
Crafted of hardened glass and held together by magically treated lead, glass golems are both deadly guardians and works of exquisite art. Glass golems most often protect grand cathedrals or opulent palaces—testaments to the wealth and power of those they serve, or once served. Once spurred into action by the commands of their creators, glass golems are quicker and more agile than most other golems. Their sharp, blade-like limbs can easily sever veins and arteries, creating wounds that bleed profusely.
Of all the various types of golems, the glass golem is the one most akin to a work of art. Just as powerful aristocrats might use an ice golem for temperature regulation or a wood golem as an ego-boosting statue, a glass golem's colorful glass construction can elevate the beauty of any chamber by its mere presence.
Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called “golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.
Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell can affect the golem.
Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.
Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.
Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gnoll Cultist.
Gnoll cultists serve as their clans’ spiritual guides and conduits to the divine. As often as not, their influence drives entire gnoll civilizations to commit atrocious acts of violence and enslavement. Lamashtu and Rovagug are favored deities of gnoll cultists, and many gnolls believe their kind was in fact birthed from the womb of the Mother of Monsters. Some gnoll clans worship lesser-known demon lords or entire pantheons of sinister patrons.
Gnolls lack any particular reverence for the remains of the dead, which adds to their reputation as scavengers or even cannibals. They willingly eat nearly any other creature, including dead gnolls, which can evoke strong reactions from people and cultures with a strong taboo against cannibalism or desecrating the dead. To a gnoll, it is almost more offensive to not eat a dead body, no matter its origin; gnolls see no point in wasting precious meat in a harsh and challenging world. Worse still is the refusal to eat the esh of a dead gnoll, which they consider an insult to that gnoll’s memory and sacrifice and an implication that the gnoll’s flesh is unworthy of consumption. In fact, they refuse to eat the bodies of particularly hated foes; particularly warmongering gnolls even spike the bodies or heads of such despised enemies on tall spears, which they place around their tribal holdings to dishonor the dead and intimidate would-be invaders.
Gnoll women are far stronger and more aggressive than gnoll men and are typically considered the leaders of their hunting packs and clans. Though gnolls tend to be disorganized when it comes to practical matters or negotiations, they are extremely efficient at working together to hunt down prey or overwhelm a group of foes. Much like hyenas, they prefer to hunt in packs, and are exceptionally skilled at setting up ambushes or separating individual targets from larger groups.
The most commonly encountered gnoll clans are slavers, who travel far and wide to acquire chattel and auction off their living goods. Although not all clans engage in slavery, most are still violent toward other creatures in general. Some clans hunt people for food, others capture innocents to sacrifice to evil deities, and still others simply wish to wet their blades with blood.
Gnolls dwell primarily on dry savannas and windswept plains. Thanks to their sturdy constitutions and strong survival instincts, they have few qualms about setting up holdings out in the open. Many gnolls establish their encampments—typically made up of hide lean-tos and tents—atop sloping hills to better survey the region for potential prey. Gnolls rarely dwell in caverns or similar enclosures, knowing that it is all too easy to get cornered when there is only one exit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gnoll Hunter.
Gnoll hunters serve their clans by hunting for food in the wilds, marauding along well-traveled roads, and tracking down escaped slaves.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Gnoll Sergeant.
When gnolls band together to form hunting or raiding parties, the strongest among them is often designated the leader or sergeant. These gnolls train extensively in the art of war. Their skill at arms and the respect they command make them powerful adversaries. In smaller clans or single family units, a gnoll sergeant might also serve as the group’s leader in other affairs, such as sorting out domestic disputes or negotiating with rival gnoll clans.
Gnolls lack any particular reverence for the remains of the dead, which adds to their reputation as scavengers or even cannibals.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Goblin Commando.
The theoretical leaders of goblin raids are called goblin commandos. In practice, goblin commandos rarely continue to lead their comrades once a battle has begun. Most shirk their responsibilities in favor of wading into the fray and claiming more glory from their tribe-mates.
Goblins are superstitious, with an intense awe of magic and a fascination with fire; goblins who master magic or fire earn great respect from their kin. Most other humanoids find it difficult to understand goblins’ outlook: they hate canines but eagerly share their lairs with so-called “goblin dogs,” they fearlessly attack larger creatures but are terrified of horses, and they despise vegetables yet consider pickles a delicacy. To a goblin, of course, these are all perfectly sensible life choices.
Goblins construct warrens in forests and coastal regions, usually near the settlements of other humanoids for ease of scavenging and raiding.
Although goblin warrens are generally filthy dumps, they sometimes contain actual treasures stolen from longshanks or other goblin tribes. Typical treasures include small pieces of jewelry, shiny items such as hand mirrors, and gold teeth. As they rarely trust each other, many goblins keep their most cherished baubles on their persons; these, might include useful weapons or minor magic items.
The following ditty is perhaps the most infamous of goblin songs.
Goblins chew and goblins bite, Goblins cut and goblins fight. Stab the dog and cut the horse, Goblins eat and take by force! Goblins race and goblins jump. Goblins slash and goblins bump. Burn the skin and mash the head, Goblins here and you be dead! Chase the baby, catch the pup. Bonk the head to shut it up. Bones be cracked, flesh be stewed, We be goblins! You be food!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Goblin Dog.
Goblins’ eponymous pets aren’t true canines at all, but rather large, blunt-nosed rodents with thin bodies and long legs. As cowardly as they are ugly, goblin dogs prefer to lurk behind bushes or in deep shadows, pouncing upon lone or wounded prey. Goblin dogs frequently lair and roam in packs, but they are likely to flee from a fight if injured, even if it means abandoning their pack-mates.
Goblin dogs take their name from their long association with goblins, who breed the beasts as guard animals and mounts. Most goblins take issue with the name, as the average goblin is appalled at the suggestion that these, their favored mounts, have anything at all to do with actual dogs. Of course, being goblins, they haven’t bothered to come up with their own, unique name for goblin dogs.
Even the most pampered goblin dogs have itchy mange and prolific dander that tenaciously affects those who come in contact with them. This “goblin pox” causes itchy hives and festering sores that are as unsightly as they are irritating and distracting. Goblin dog dander causes allergic reactions in nearly all other creatures that don’t share the goblin dogs’ terrible hygiene—with the notable exception, of course, of goblins, who remain entirely immune to the disease regardless of cleanliness.
Hunger can drive goblin dogs to bouts of uncharacteristic violence; many goblins purposefully starve their pets to make them more aggressive in battle. Goblin dogs subsist on whatever organic material they can scavenge, and they particularly enjoy fresh carrion. Although goblins are far from picky eaters, they value goblin dogs as pets because the noisome animals will consume food that even goblins won’t dare to eat. “Will it eat?” is one of several games goblins enjoy playing with their goblin dog pets, where a wide range of mouth-sized morsels (not always edible or safe to consume) are dangled before a goblin dog’s snout. “Will it die?” is often a game played after “Will it eat?” Goblin dogs who survive the second game earn renown for their digestive prowess and often become favored tribal pets treated better than most of the rank-and-file goblins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Goblin Pyro.
Some goblins take their people’s admiration of fire fully into the realm of deadly obsession. These pyromaniacs can be a great boon to a band of goblin raiders eager to torch their enemies and wreak havoc. More often, however, their presence is a double-edged sword; in the heat of the moment, goblin pyros sometimes lose sight of their tribe’s goals and simply set fire to anything that will burn—including their own allies.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Gogiteth.
A gogiteth is a slavering nightmare of teeth, eyes, and hairy spiderlike legs, and its appearance is invariably seared into the minds of any who witness it. Hives of these skittering monsters haunt the lowest reaches of the Darklands, competing with cave worms and other subterranean horrors for food and resources. A gogiteth is rarely seen alone, as these oversized vermin learned long ago that the best means of survival is sticking close to others of their own kind. Even the haughty drow know to seek cover when a gogiteth is spotted, for where there is one, a swarm is sure to follow.
Gogiteths make a clacking sound as they move about. The joints in their many legs pop and crack with each movement, though they can suppress this sound voluntarily so that they can hunt without giving away their presence. The odd creatures can also make a high-pitched whistling sound that echoes throughout the caverns where they live. Some Darklands natives report that groups of gogiteths sometimes join together in eerie, discordant songs.
Gogiteths’ alien anatomies have inspired no shortage of speculative origin stories. Some believe they are the result of a fleshwarping experiment gone horribly wrong. Others think they may be related in some way to the Dominion of the Black—possibly the distant cousins or some strange exile of that alien entity; according to this mythos, once they made their way to this planet, the gogiteths crawled into the depths of the earth, shying away from the blazing sun above.
Gogiteths are a menace to every other denizen of the Darklands. Drow and duergars in gogiteth-infested regions of Sekamina or Orv frequently organize hunting parties to eradicate the terrors, even calling for temporary truces with unlikely allies in times when a gogiteth presence must be addressed. Since even an average gogiteth hive can host up to two dozen of the horrors, missions to eradicate them when they become established are dangerous quests indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Goliath Spider.
Goliath spiders dwell in the deepest jungles, where they build webs as big as temples and feast on prey as large as hippopotami.
Though they are vermin incapable of forming true alliances, spiders show up alongside many types of creatures, including web lurkers. Spellcasters sometimes call upon spiders using summon animal, and spider swarms have a way of popping up just about anywhere at the most inopportune times.
A staggering number of species of giant spider exist in the world. Some, like the dream spider, whose venom creates strange hallucinations, are relatively small. Others, like the lumbering ogre spider, are larger than horses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gorgon.
Though they may resemble constructs to the untrained eye due to their metallic, interlocking armor plates that look and feel like polished stone, gorgons are a creature of flesh and bone. These ill-tempered beasts greet interlopers with a charge or trample accompanied with belches of petrifying breath. Gorgons are dangerous on their own, and when they band together in herds, they become especially deadly.
Gorgons typically subsist on petrified flesh or fossils. These supernatural beasts can gain sustenance from natural stone if they must, though they find raw stone flavorless, so it's not a preferred food source. In battle, gorgons use their petrifying breath to turn their prey into stone. They break up the resulting statues with their hooves or horns and swallow the stony chunks with loud chewing bites. Gorgons cannot digest unpetrified organic material, and if they try, they experience sickness and great gastrointestinal peril. Such discomforts are not life threatening to gorgons, but they do make the creatures even more ill tempered than usual—much to the chagrin of anyone they subsequently encounter.
Gorgon flesh tastes vaguely like beef, but with a gritty, earthy texture and aftertaste that most meat connoisseurs find off-putting. Creatures with a close association to earth and stone are more likely to find the flavor appetizing; stone giants in particular consider gorgon steaks to be delicacies. Some cultures, notably dwarven cultures, consider the preparation of gorgon for meals as both a physical and a culinary challenge. Chefs who work with gorgon flesh can find renown for their skill in creating palatable dishes from such naturally unpalatable meat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gorilla.
Gorillas can be territorial creatures, particularly if provoked by hunters or the presence of more dangerous monsters. A gorilla uses its fangs and powerful arms to bite and pummel trespassers with wild abandon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gosreg.
Gosregs are agents of the Dominion of the Black that insinuate themselves into humanoid societies to foster the goals of their sinister alien masters. They act as spies and special forces that can mingle with humanoid society while enacting plans for the rest of the Dominion in secret.
In their natural forms, gosregs dart about in a jerky gallop due to their stumpy legs and gangly arms. They take on the appearances of humanoids to infiltrate societies, and they drop their disguises only when they feel they are ultimately compromised and must resort to physical violence to protect their agendas. Their brain-like heads and bestial legs suggest a potential link with a similar Dominion of the Black agent: the dreaded intellect devourer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gourd Leshy.
Gourd leshys are guardians of fields, gardens, and farms. Many villages benefit from the protection of a gourd leshy, even if they are unaware of it.
Because of their relative frailty, leaf leshys frequently act as liaisons and call upon more powerful forest guardians when their domains are threatened. Nymphs, sprites, and other goodly fey may respond to the call of a leaf leshy, as do arboreals and other plant creatures.
When a leshy dies, its body explodes in a wave of vegetation as its spirit returns to the natural world. Though leshy spirits that are called into new bodies after death typically keep only vague recollections of their pasts, they retain many of the values and habits of their former life.
Leshys are fairly egalitarian when interacting with their own kind. Most communities are meritocracies, rewarding leshys who defend their communities and help each other succeed, and they see working together as the best path to a successful future.
Occasionally, a leshy proves so valuable to their community that they're uplifted as a hero. These admired leshys are not all warriors; outstanding artisans, caretakers, or diplomats might also be lauded as heroes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Granite Glyptodont.
This squat and stony creature looks like an armadillo with a large raised back and a flail-like tail. The granite glyptodont has no true need to feed, as with all elementals, yet it does seem to linger after transforming the flesh of those it calcifies, as if the mere proximity of flesh fossilizing into stone pleases it somehow.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Earth elementals sometimes have valuable gemstones or minerals incorporated into their bodies, and once they are slain, these valuables can be scavenged as treasure. Gemstones, precious metals such as silver or gold ore, or rarer materials such as mithral or adamantine can be harvested from these creatures, although the more expensive finds tend to be incorporated into only the most powerful earth elementals.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Grauladon.
Grauladons are vicious predators that appear crocodilian in form, but are in fact distant offshoots of dragonkind. They make their dens in the shallows of fetid ponds or isolated corners of larger bodies of water, usually in rural swamps or woodlands. Driven almost entirely by their base desire to feed, grauladons spend most of their time swimming leisurely underwater looking for prey such as fish or waterfowl. Possessed of a greed befitting their more majestic dragon cousins, grauladons often take down prey larger than they need, jealously guarding the corpses to keep scavengers away even as the meat rots. A typical grauladon is 16 feet long from its snout to the tip of its tail and weighs 1,500 pounds.
A grauladon’s stench may seem supernaturally disgusting, but it is simply the result of the creature’s fetid habitat and diet of rotting, waterlogged meat. As grauladons’ exhalations bear a passing resemblance to dragons’ breath, they have earned the nickname “mud drakes” from rural folk.
Grauladons can be found in both fresh and brackish water in most temperate climates. They prefer to lair in shallow waters, particularly where reeds or other foliage conceal their bulk from unsuspecting prey. Grauladons are highly territorial and won’t tolerate other predators living or hunting near their homes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Graveknight.
Graveknights are undead warriors granted unlife by a cursed suit of armor.
Darkvision
Negative Healing
Rejuvenation (divine, necromancy) When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of 1d10 days—or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host (see Graveknight Armor, below). If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts. A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with disintegrate), transporting it to the Positive Energy Plane, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano.
Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious, plus one energy type (the same chosen for ruinous weapons below).
Sacrilegious Aura (abjuration, aura, divine, evil) 30 feet. When a creature in the aura uses a positive spell or ability, the graveknight automatically attempts to counteract it, with the listed counteract modifier. Devastating Blast (arcane, evocation) The graveknight unleashes a 30-foot cone of energy. Creatures in the area take 1d12 damage, plus an additional 1d12 damage for every two levels the graveknight has (basic Reflex save). The graveknight can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. This energy damage is of the same type as that of its ruinous weapons (see below); Devastating Blast gains the associated energy trait. Phantom Mount (arcane, conjuration, summon) The graveknight summons a supernatural mount as per phantom steed, heightened to a level equal to half the graveknight's level. Unlike phantom steed, the steed's AC and saving throw bonuses are all 4 lower than the graveknight's, and the steed has one-third the graveknight's Hit Points (rounded down). If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1 hour before using this ability again. Ruinous Weapons At the time of its creation, a graveknight chooses one of the following energy types that was relevant to its life or death: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Any weapon the graveknight wields gains the effects of the caustic, frost, shock, or flaming weapon rune, respectively, in addition to a +1 striking weapon rune. If the graveknight is 14th level or higher, its weapons instead gain the effects of the greater versions of both of these runes. Weapon Master The graveknight has access to the critical specialization effects of any weapons it wields. Alternate Graveknight Abilities Although the abilities listed above are standard for a graveknight, you can create a more unusual graveknight by substituting one of the aforementioned abilities (except for its rejuvenation ability) with one of the following. Betrayed Revivification The graveknight died after being deeply betrayed. Instead of being immune to a type of energy damage, it is immune to mental damage, its weapons deal 1d6 additional mental damage, and its Devastating Blast deals mental damage with a Will saving throw instead of Reflex. Create Grave Squire The graveknight can gift a piece of its armor to a willing ally, which becomes its grave squire. The graveknight can communicate telepathically with its squire at any distance, see through the squire's senses, and cast suggestion as a divine innate spell through the telepathic link at will; the squire treats its degree of success as one step worse. If the graveknight's main armor is destroyed, the squire's piece expands to cover the squire's body over 1d10 days, after which point it becomes the graveknight's new body. The graveknight can have only one squire at a time, and must recover the gifted piece of armor if it wishes to create a new squire. Dark Deliverance The graveknight has positive resistance equal to its level. Graveknight Armor Wearing graveknight armor is very risky, for the graveknight's essence rapidly parasitizes the new wearer, accelerating the graveknight's rejuvenation. This agonizing transformation inevitably kills the host, transforming their flesh into the graveknight's new body. Removing the curse allows a character to remove the armor, but if it ever wears the armor again, the curse returns. If the wearer dies from another cause while wearing the armor, or if the graveknight's rejuvenation completes before the wearer dies from the curse, the wearer immediately progresses to stage 3. Graveknight's Curse (arcane, curse, necromancy) This curse affects anyone who wears a graveknight's armor for at least 1 hour. Saving Throw Will save; Onset 1 hour; Stage 1 doomed 1 and cannot remove the armor (1 day); Stage 2 doomed 2, hampered 10, and cannot remove the armor (1 day); Stage 3 dies and transforms into the armor's graveknight. Infamous GraveknightsSeveral of Golarion's most notorious villains are graveknights. The following examples are among the world's most infamous graveknights at large, and may inspire or serve as villains in your own games. Lictor Shokneir: Once the Hellknight leader of the notorious Order of the Crux, Lictor Shokneir was disgraced when he refused a royal order to disband his army of butchers. The other Hellknights surrounded him and razed his castle, Citadel Gheisteno, to the ground. However, Shokneir's determination sustains his now-undead form, and he and his undead legions have rebuilt the citadel in all its haunting glory. The Black Prince: Although the graveknight known simply as the Black Prince was redeemed centuries ago as part of Iomedae's 11 Acts, it is said that the prince's armor remains intact—and that vile forces conspire to reclaim it. If the armor is donned by one of the Black Prince's descendants, the Inner Sea will be beset by a terrible villain indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Graveshell.
The graveshell is a dangerous predator that draws scavengers and explorers into its grasp using a morbid lure: the corpse of a former victim impaled upon the spikes that protrude from its large, turtle-like shell. Aside from its shell, the monster resembles no known animal. Small but bright yellow eyes watch from the sagging flesh of its head, the most prominent feature of which is a curiously shaped, toothy maw twisted into a perpetual grin. Its stubby arms and legs are impractical for both walking and swimming, though the algae-caked claws tipping each limb are deadly weapons.
Graveshells are intelligent—a fact that surprises many who encounter them—and surrender rather than fight to the death. These monsters have little to offer in exchange for their lives, though the waterlogged treasures on their collection of corpses may entice opportunists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gray Ooze.
These dangerous oozes are the bane of any who travel through swamps, marshes, or damp caves. Easily masquerading as pools of clear water or patches of wet stone, gray oozes lie in wait for unwary victims to reach down for a drink or step into what appears to be a puddle, then lash out with whiplike pseudopods to ensnare and consume their hapless prey.
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms are usually found near each other, as the two oozes are part of the same life cycle. When a giant amoeba grows large enough, it can spontaneously split apart into two separate amoeba swarms, and when an amoeba swarm feeds enough, its individual components can fuse together into a single creature.
Many oozes have acidic attacks that can quickly degrade flesh, wood, and even stronger materials. Some believe that oozes are the result of alchemical or magical experimentation run amok, while others postulate that they simply emerged from the natural processes of evolution.
Many varieties of these nearly mindless predators exist in the world. Some are mere variants, with different colored puddings, jellies, and oozes with little to differentiate them from those presented here other than their habitat. Others are more specialized, or even dangerously intelligent. The shoggoth is one such example, but another variety of deadly and powerful ooze is the thankfully rare blight, a creature composed of protoplasm and eyes that curses entire regions with its presence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Great Cyclops.
Gigantic, dim-witted loners, the great cyclopes embody their lesser kin writ large. They are both stronger and more violent, but their uncontrolled vision into possible futures has driven them beyond reason. They see every moment as a potential storm of uncontrollable fury, and out of a desperate desire for peace, quiet, and an end to their hunger, they lash out at all who come near. Wise creatures avoid great cyclopes at all cost.
Debate has long raged over the origins of these massive, destructive giants. They are so large that it had long been assumed they were used as beasts of burden by their lesser kin, but they are now free to hunt and kill without restraint. Other scholars believe the great cyclops is the ultimate fate of the entire cyclops species. Whatever foolish decision or wayward curse caused the end of their civilization is still playing out, occasionally causing a cyclops to withdraw from its own kind, lose all semblance of intellect, and mutate into a lumbering, feral colossus. It is fortunate indeed that the great cyclops prefers to dwell far from humanoid settlements, because its immeasurable bloodlust inspires it to destroy virtually anything that moves, from dinosaurs and other monsters to the occasional explorer or soon-to-be-lost caravan.
Great cyclopes are traditionally violent creatures, but some retain fragments of the old ways that lull them into periods of calm. During such times, they can be incredible sources of information, but one must take care to be well away from the great cyclops’s lair before its bestial rage wakens once more.
Cyclopes dwell in or near the remains of their lost civilizations—notably Ghol-Gan in Garund, Koloran in northwestern Casmaron, and various kingdoms in Iblydos. Ruins of Ghol-Gan still dot the archipelago of the Shackles, and untold numbers of treasures belonging to the ancient cyclops empire still await discovery. Pirates and treasure hunters regularly conduct expeditions in search of lost Ghol-Gani relics, but many of these voyages never return. Among those that do, survivors speak of terrible curses, gruesome traps, and one-eyed undead guardians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Greater Barghest.
Once a barghest has eaten enough to grow into a greater barghest, it typically seeks a method to leave the Material Plane and return to the Abyss, there joining other fiends as yet another of that plane’s horrors. As barghests have no innate ability to travel the planes, though, the time it takes for most greater barghests to engineer such a return can usually be measured in years, if not decades. During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few grow accustomed to such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make such a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new abilities and qualities absorbed from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself.
In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests, the process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations that often grant deadly abilities. Some barghests grow large bat-like wings upon their transformation. Others develop toxic breath or vestigial limbs. The options detailed in the stats below represent only the tip of the proverbial iceberg for barghest mutations—feel free to use these as inspiration for coming up with new mutations of your own design.
The barghest hero-gods may be the only ones of their kind capable of granting spells to their clerics, but the idea of adoring worshippers appeals to all barghests. A barghest that completes its transformation into a greater barghest, and thus is no longer morbidly distracted by its hunger, often plays the role of a deity to ignorant groups of goblins or other monsters. To them, the fact that the barghest can’t grant spells is irrelevant—rather, their veneration is due the fact that worshipping the barghest is the best way to keep it from devouring the entire tribe.
The four barghests stolen from Hell’s kennels by the deity Lamashtu were not the originals of their kind, but they were then and remain today the most powerful. Now they are denizens of the Abyss, dwelling in their own realm adjacent to Lamashtu’s domain, and are heavily worshipped by goblins across multiple worlds as “hero-gods.” These four barghests include Hadregash the slaver, Venkelvore the torturer, Zarongel the dog slayer, and Zogmugot the scavenger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Greater Nightmare.
The enormous greater nightmare is a more dangerous variety of nightmare, particularly valued for its ability to invade other realities with its rider.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Greater Shadow.
Shadows that spend long amounts of time on the Shadow Plane and absorb its magic become greater shadows.
Shadows might lurk in any dimly lit area—a corner in a crumbling ruin, a room lit by flickering candles, or a shaded forest at dusk. They travel to and from the Shadow Plane, though it is unclear if they do so via their own magic or by aligning themselves with a more powerful being capable of such planar shifting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Great White Shark.
An apex predator among the coastal surface waters where it hunts, the great white shark is one of the largest shark species. These silent killers glide gracefully through the ocean, always in search of their next meal.
Contrary to popular belief, sharks are not particularly fond of humanoids as meals. Only under the right conditions—such as when food is scarce or the shark mistakes its victim for a seal—will a shark attack a swimmer or small boat. Such occasions are traumatic enough for survivors to perpetuate the myth of shark as maneater.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Green Hag.
Green hags hate beauty and purity, so they use disguises and treachery to lure and murder innocents, corrupt the pure of heart, and shatter the minds and morals of their victims. Green hags create imaginative schemes to utterly ruin anyone who crosses them, as well as good or righteous folk whose very existence insults the hag’s twisted sensibilities. The complicated scandals perpetuated by green hags involve impersonation, mistaken identity, the seduction and betrayal of loved ones, or all these things in combination.
Hags are dangerous enough on their own, but when they gather in threes to form covens, they grow much more powerful.
Hags loathe all humanoid races, but not equally—the brunt of their wrath is leveled against humans. Hags prey on human society the most, adding human flesh to their cauldron and snatching newborn children before replacing the babes with their own progeny as changelings.
The four types of hags presented here are but the most notorious of their kind. Others—such as the blood hag, moon hag, storm hag, and winter hag—plague society in other regions of the world.
Some believe that hags possess no true form or body of their own, but instead manifest from society’s fear of aging. That no known male hags exist has also puzzled scholars, but perhaps this is but another way in which hags mock society—by presenting themselves as awful stereotypes of elderly women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Grendel.
This reaver of the cold marsh is not just a monster; he is a force of nature. Where there is peace and prosperity in the world, Grendel strikes, eager to prove that tranquility is transitory and death is the only constant. He stalks the edge of his fens, seeking settlements where joy holds sway. He strikes under cover of night, primarily targeting celebrations or festivals. The more happiness or joy he can extinguish, the better.
Although Grendel is a unique creature, killing him won't save the world from his ravages for long. Once Grendel's mother instinctively feels the pain of her violent son's death, she soon births a replacement. The new Grendel seems to avoid the sites his elder brothers terrorized, as if he instinctively knows that such a place hosts heroes powerful enough to defeat him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Griffon.
Griffons are regal beasts revered as symbols of freedom and strength in many cultures. They are physically striking, with the hindquarters of a lion and the head, wings, and forelimbs of a great bird of prey—typically an eagle, but some instead bear the features of a hawk, falcon, or even osprey or vulture. In rare cases, the griffon’s hindquarters may resemble those of a different great cat, such as a leopard or tiger. The variations seem to conform to the environment in which the griffon lives—for instance, the especially rare griffons of northern Avistan have the hindquarters of a Grungir lynx and the upper body of a snowy owl—though this is not always the case. Some griffons lack wings altogether. These wingless griffons, known as alces, result from a rare mutation. Among a clutch of other griffons, the alce is typically considered the runt, so few of these offshoots survive their fledgling stage. Those alces that do make it to adulthood tend to be tougher, more violent, and more aloof than most griffons.
Wild griffons rely on their powerful wings to hold them aloft and their keen eyesight to spy out prey. The speed with which they plunge toward the ground and grab up their victims is shocking. They may tear open victim’s flesh with their razor-sharp beaks, but usually just take their prey to a high, secluded location where they can enjoy their feast without interruptions. On the ground, they take cover and leap out to ambush prey, then fly off with their prize. The exception to this is when a griffon is hunting to feed its offspring, in which case it will almost never purposefully bring a living creature back to its nest for fear of endangering its chicks.
Skilled animal trainers long ago learned how to raise griffons as mounts for military forces or powerful individuals. Such mounts are known for their strength, bravery, and unfailing loyalty. They are among the smartest of animals and possess a wisdom not normally afforded most animals; it is thought that a griffon chooses its rider as much as a rider chooses the griffon. The process of training a griffon to accept and carry a rider in flight is a long and expensive ordeal. Griffon trainers charge rich sums for their services, and a ruler who can boast of owning a stable of griffons is the subject of great respect and envy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Grig.
Grigs are kindly musicians of the fey, often getting themselves into trouble due to their penchant for confronting evil well beyond their ability to vanquish. Even so, they fight bravely and with great cunning, using their magic and ranged sonic attacks while flying and leaping using their wings and powerful cricket-like lower torsos to stay out of reach.
Sprite pranks tend to be kind‑hearted in nature; they might use their abilities to embarrass a braggart or to trick them into a convoluted scheme to help someone notice an admirer who has been there for them all along. Their plans are often half-baked; sprites’ mercurial nature means they can easily become distracted by something new before following through on a previous plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Grikkitog.
Grikkitogs, also known as “hungry earth,” are strange parasites from the Plane of Earth that infest and possess earth, rock, and stone in order to feed their endless hunger. A young grikkitog is a formless apparition until it corrupts an earth elemental host, forming the grikkitog’s core. A grikkitog can then infest the earth and stone nearby with its voracious essence, forming maws and eyes all around it. These creatures are particularly dangerous to small creatures that lair within gaps and holes among rocks, as well as mountain climbers searching for the perfect handhold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Grim Reaper.
The Grim Reaper is the unflinching personification of death. Silent as the grave and as inevitable as time itself, this legendary being hunts down and finishes creatures that have evaded death for far too long. Sometimes the Grim Reaper comes without warning, while at others it comes to finish the work that other creatures could not. The Grim Reaper serves no god, fiend, or aeon. It is both despised and feared by psychopomps and celestials, but few—if any—dare to stand in its way. Like some eternal plague, it kills those who try to cure the multiverse of its presence. It stands alone and holds only its own council, and the pleading and reasoning of mortals and immortals alike fall on deaf ears once the Grim Reaper closes on its quarry. Its own reasoning is silent to mortal ears and inscrutable to the mortal mind, but no matter the reason, the result is unyielding and final.
While some legends hold that the Grim Reaper appears before everyone as they die, the truth is quite a bit more disturbing. Such vigils in fact lie within the providence of the psychopomps, a race of immortals charged with the protection and guidance of mortal souls through the afterlife. The Grim Reaper has little interest in protecting souls or guiding them. It is instead compelled by sinister agendas arising within the nighted realm of Abaddon, where the Horsemen of the Apocalypse rule. Indeed there are many similarities in shape and form between the Grim Reaper and Charon, the Horseman of Death, but no recorded instance exists of these two powerful entities working together. Instead, the Grim Reaper serves as something of a manifestation of Abaddon itself, and in this regard is believed by some to be an incarnation of the mysterious First Horseman. When the Grim Reaper comes to a world, it does so not as an angel of mercy, but as a relentless harvester of life. Those who fall to the Grim Reaper were not destined to die as much as they were selected, hunted, and murdered.
Perhaps the most frightening legends surrounding the Grim Reaper concern its nature as a singular entity, for some believe that more than one grim reaper exists in the Great Beyond. These whispers tell of a cabal of at least nine of these creatures that stalk reality, culling the living as inexplicable servants of true entropy. According to the teaching of some death cults, the final goal of the Grim Reaper is to end the entire cycle of life and death and serve as a silent lord of an empty universe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Grimstalker.
These violently murderous fey have one purpose: to stealthily hunt down and slay humanoids brazen enough to dare set foot in the wilderness. Though they prefer to hunt from the shadows, grimstalkers do not fear taking their grisly work to the very edges of civilization. This boldness serves as a reminder that nature can be cruel, capricious, and owes no debt to humanity. Grimstalkers are happy to perform nature's dirty work and particularly enjoy targeting loggers, hunters, and explorers, regardless of whether they respect the natural setting they work or travel within.
Grimstalkers are gaunt and hairless, and their mottled, green and brown flesh gives them the appearance of moss-draped bark. When damaged, they bleed a thick, sap-like blood. They mark their territories by lopping off the heads of their victims and stringing them up in the surrounding trees, a practice that often lures dangerous scavengers into their lands. Carnivorous and thorny plants are often found in wilds where grimstalkers dwell, filling roles that pets might in human society, though grimstalkers tend to treat these “pets” poorly at best.
There are few accounts of grimstalkers working with other fey—for the most part, grimstalkers see their kin from the First World as cowards or weaklings, or perhaps both. Even notoriously violent fey such as redcaps shy from them, as grimstalkers consider their own kind the only company worth keeping.
Grimstalkers hunt in small bands, using stealth to approach their targets. They surround enemies first, then work to unnerve them by knocking on trees or howling out threats in Aklo to distract and panic their quarry. Of course, a band of grimstalkers won't stay together for long, quickly succumbing to bickering and infighting. These violent arguments are common pastimes among grimstalkers, often ending with each grimstalker going its own way. Not even the presence of more powerful fey or commanding creatures can keep grimstalkers from their predisposed bickering. Some scholars theorize that this quality speaks to an ancient curse that once afflicted fey who were judged too cantankerous, but in truth, it's just part of what makes a grimstalker what it is: ill-tempered, confrontational, and bitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Grindylow.
The top half of a grindylow looks vaguely like that of a goblin, but from the waist down, their bodies split into a tangle of suckered, wriggling tentacles. They dwell mostly in shallow waters both fresh and briny, including lakes, rivers, coastal regions, and near coral reefs. Grindylows generally organize into schools ranging from a few individuals to a few hundred. Smaller schools can sometimes be brought under the leadership of a powerful aquatic creature, though such alliances last only until the school faces a major setback, at which point the surviving grindylows scatter and form smaller schools of their own.
Grindylows aren't territorial, but they are pragmatic; while they rarely build permanent structures, they will adopt a good hunting ground for generations until driven away by predators. They often lair in mobile shelters, such as a sargasso of seaweed or the hull of an abandoned ship. They are skilled scavengers and hunters that eat anything they can sink their teeth into.
Grindylows respect the power of bigger sea predators but have a special hatred for squids (or anything they believe looks like a squid). Sailors plying grindylow-infested waters often paint the images of squids on the bottoms of their hulls in hopes of warding the little terrors off. While this can keep smaller schools at bay, it can also backfire, potentially inciting larger groups to gather for a coordinated attack; this becomes especially more likely if the ship's route becomes predictable. This hatred of squids does not extend to other tentacled creatures; grindylows consider octopuses to be the epitome of grace and power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Grippli Archer.
These sharpshooters are renowned for their patience and their accuracy.
Whatever region they come from, gripplis tend to be peaceful huntergatherers. Due to their modest understanding of agriculture, gripplis don’t raise crops in the traditional sense, although they do cultivate mushroom patches and gather a wide array of fruits from the surrounding wilderness. The jungle also contains rivers and lakes filled with silver-scaled fish, which gripplis harvest in a sustainable manner to ensure their future supply, as well as fatty insects that grow much larger than in other parts of the world. Some of the most advanced grippli societies capture and breed these insects, nurturing herds of giant dragonflies or beetles that are eventually slaughtered for food for the rest of the village. Particularly enterprising gripplis even seek out and tame huge flying insects to use as mounts during their hunts. The rearing of such massive insects is no easy feat, however, so gripplis who manage to do so are often heralded as local heroes.
The treetop settlements of the grippli are difficult to spot from the forest floor. Gripplis obscure their holdings with broad leaves and thick branches, and they riddle the surrounding forest with labyrinthine trails that only they know how to navigate. Their villages are usually constructed among the densest populations of trees, with thin rope bridges strung between wide wooden platforms built around each trunk.
Grippli villages rarely get involved in the concerns of other communities, preferring to focus on maintaining relative peace within their own small societies. Grippli legends explain this attitude with a tale of a grippli champion who dragged his people into a war between humans and charau-kas. The stories differ as to which side the gripplis took, but every version ends with the bloody deaths of the hero and his family. Since that time, village elders claim, gripplis have strove to remain far from the conflicts of others.

Gripplis keep company with few other intelligent species, but their close bond with nature means they may be found alongside giant insects, plant creatures, and other beasts of the jungle.
A grippli’s knowledge is often more valuable than any of the handcrafted weapons or goods it carries. However, the most esteemed members of grippli communities— alchemists, greenspeakers, and scouts—often carry alchemical creations, magic items, or valuables meant for trading with members of other jungle civilizations.<|endoftext|>

The unofficial healers of gripplikind are known as greenspeakers.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Grippli Scout.
Gripplis make their homes in the treetops of tropical jungles and forests. These frog-like humanoids are uniquely adapted to their environment, with oversized eyes that give them keen vision in both light and dark and large toes that allow them to easily scale trees. Gripplis vary widely in physical appearance, with their physiologies influenced by their surrounding environment. Those who live in verdant forests, for example, typically have bright green skin and red eyes. In contrast, gripplis who live in regions of rot and decay have mottled-brown coloration, and those who dwell near lakes or streams may bear bright blue and orange stripes. Typical gripplis stand just over 2 feet tall and weigh approximately 30 pounds.
Whatever region they come from, gripplis tend to be peaceful hunter-gatherers. Due to their modest understanding of agriculture, gripplis don't maintain typical farms like other humanoids do. Rather, they cultivate mushroom patches and gather a wide array of fruits from the surrounding wilderness. While most gripplis hunt insects, some societies also capture and breed them, nurturing herds of giant dragonflies or beetles that they eventually slaughter for food. Particularly enterprising gripplis might even seek out and tame larger flying insects to use as mounts during their hunts. The rearing of such massive insects is no easy feat, however, so gripplis who manage to do so are often heralded as local heroes.
Gripplis usually construct their villages in particularly dense copses, stringing thin rope bridges between wide wooden platforms built around each trunk. They make use of broad leaves and thick branches to further obscure their villages, making them especially difficult to spot from the forest floor, and riddle the surrounding forest with labyrinthine trails that only they can navigate.
Grippli scouts typically keep watch on the outskirts of grippli settlements. More potent gripplis inhabit the settlements, be they religious leaders, powerful druids, or agile warriors that, due to their small size, focus more on finesse weapons and ranged attacks than on melee tactics.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Grizzly Bear.
This large and powerful omnivore inhabits forested hills. While it typically sustains itself on nuts, berries, fish, and small mammals, it’s fiercely territorial and will chase off or kill any creature it views as competition. Grizzly bears are especially temperamental when their young are nearby. In combat, a grizzly bear often attempts to grab and maul its foe with surprising ferocity. It continues its assault until its foe seems like it is no longer a threat, though if the bear is hungry, it will not hesitate to feed.
A bear den can contain valuable treasures, such as the remains of less fortunate adventurers who stumbled into a hungry bear’s path. Bear furs themselves are valued as rugs, while their claws and fangs make for impressive jewelry or adornments for armor. Bear hide is an excellent resource for hide armor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Grodair.
Grodairs are bizarre fishlike creature native to the First World. Their supernatural physiology includes a strange organ with an extradimensional space capable of storing thousands of gallons of water. This grants grodairs the ability to create a suitable environment for themselves anywhere by releasing the water, quickly transforming any surrounding land into a shallow bog. When grodairs wish to leave for a new location, they simply suck up all the water back up. When necessary, grodairs can also travel on land by walking upon the tangle of long, fleshy tentacles that dangle from their bellies.
Grodairs have two sets of eyes that function independently. While this makes the creatures difficult to surprise, it also makes them easy to distract. During conversations, they have a tendency to lose focus quickly and have difficulty remembering things. Still, they are avid conversationalists and enjoy hearing tales about the world. While this quality makes grodairs quite likable, they aren't reliable. They have difficulty following plans or schedules, and they can keep a secret only if they happen to forget it first. For these reasons, grodairs don't always make the best allies.
Grodairs are voracious and curious omnivores who love trying new foods—in fact, the pursuit of new and interesting food is the most common reason that they venture out of First World. They can also capture and store within their throats any small animals and plants easily suspended in water, and eject them for consumption at a later time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Grothlut.
Sluglike abominations, grothluts are fleshwarps that were once humans. While their head and torsos are vaguely human, their arms are rubbery and move awkwardly at their sides. Wretched creatures, they moan piteously when other creatures are near, perhaps as the last remnants of their shattered human consciousness pleads to be free from their horrid warped form.
Many fleshwarpers consider the grothlut to be a failure of a creation, as the transformation all but stamps out the human consciousness. Others disagree, arguing that warping the creature’s mind makes it all the more useful, since its stupidity makes it pliable and easy to herd. Drow typically use grothluts as guardians that slowly patrol the edges of their enclaves. Once in position, grothluts can be used as crude shock troops, unleashed to soften enemy forces before more-valuable warriors wade in and cut down the enemies who have been nauseated by the grothluts’ exploded organs and flesh.
Not every fleshwarp emerges from its vat capable of survival. Many perish within minutes, as organs fundamental for life simply fail or collapse in on themselves. Fleshwarpers can usually recycle failed fleshwarps back into the mix quickly enough, but now and then, remnants known as fleshdregs are stable enough to live pain-wracked lives of their own. These foul creatures often infest fleshwarper holdings, like rats or other vermin do in less awful locations.
Grothluts may be the weakest example of a fleshwarp, and driders the most successful, but others exist as well. Ghonhatines are lumbering fleshwarps formed from xulgaths, while the tentacled irnakurses are formed from surface-dwelling elves. Sinspawn are fleshwarps as well, of course, although their methods of creation differ drastically from the techniques mastered by drow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Guard Dog.
The typical guard dog is loyal to and beloved by many communities. Often adored as pets, they also excel as protectors and trackers, and can be fearless when defending a beloved master or family member. The statistics presented below work well for any number of breeds of dog ranging from 20 to 50 pounds in weight. Wild dogs can also use these statistics, but their untamed nature makes them far more unpredictable and threatening. Feral dogs are perhaps even more dangerous, for unlike their wild cousins, feral dogs often lack the instinctual fear of humanity that stops wild creatures from interacting with people.
While many societies adore dogs and value them for their loyalty as pets, no affliction other than rabies can reverse sentiments about these creatures quite so easily. While many animals can be afflicted with this debilitating illness, something about a loyal family pet growing feral and violent as a result of the disease makes it that much worse.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Guardian Naga.
The opposite of dark nagas in many ways, guardian nagas are benevolent and wise protectors of places of great natural or supernatural significance: ancient oak groves, forgotten holy temples, and vaults of sacred power are just a few examples of locations that these nagas protect. Guardian nagas believe that the beautiful elements of the cosmos are worthy of protection and that devotion to such a grand effort is its own reward. A guardian naga may join a group with similar values, such as a sect of priests or monks, to aid it in its holy endeavors and to exchange knowledge of the heavens.
Guardian nagas usually encourage their young, upon reaching adulthood, to depart the nest and seek out their own natural wonders or ancient ruins to protect. Sometimes generations of guardian nagas might guard the same place, passing the honor of such care from parent to child. In such cases, the parent nagas aim to have at least one of their children elect to stay behind and become the guardian of their ancestral ward, giving the parents the peace of mind that the site they protect will continue to be guarded by their descendants.
It is difficult for many societies that vilify serpents or see them as symbols of evil to accept the fact that guardian nagas are benevolent and kindly. Fortunately for these people, guardian nagas are also patient and understanding, and see encounters with such societies as opportunities to educate and expand worldviews.
Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society—an entire empire ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers with a patriotic pride that borders on worship.
Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins. In many cases, these nagas have heard of distant Nagajor, but they are usually unwilling to abandon their own pursuits to seek out a land where they might be worshipped as gods.
Dark nagas might rule over goblins, orcs, xulgaths, or decadent folk, especially corrupt aristocrats. Guardian nagas might be found with other goodly creatures of any sort, from fey in natural sites to constructs in ancient vaults.
Beyond the sinister dark naga and the benevolent guardian naga, many other types of nagas exist, including the mesmerizing spirit naga, the multiheaded royal naga, and the introspective and mysterious lunar naga.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gug.
A gug’s most horrid feature is its barrel-shaped head, which splits vertically to reveal numerous rows of sharp, yellow teeth and an open throat. Its eyes on either side of its head-jaw are small but keen. Bony ridges protect its eyes from the frantic flailing of its prey, as it prefers meals of raw and writhing meat over fungi and molds. It grips said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair of forearms, giving it four clawed paws. These monstrous brutes are covered with shaggy black fur, often crusted with blood and gore.
Although gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed paw-prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs’ wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.
Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them; however, this strange fear doesn’t apply to ghasts, whom gugs consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.
Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds, although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies their immense size. Their light step and ability to squeeze through very small crannies makes gugs common bogeymen in tales of strange disappearances or bloody massacres.
Some particularly bloodthirsty gugs gain awful powers as gifts from their eldritch patrons. These monsters are known as savants, are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells. Though each savant’s precise mix of spells varies, normally, these spells grant invisibility, offer power to manipulate and change rock, or invoke awful and destructive energies upon living flesh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Guthallath.
A guthallath is an enormous construct created long ago by some unknown empire, probably as a war machine. Nearly 100 feet tall, this massive stone statue typically resembles a stalwart warrior wearing only a loincloth and skullcap. Few have seen the entire body of a guthallath, though; most of the time such a relic is buried up to its neck, covered in moss and stranded in some forgotten place. Yet, every so often, one of these harbingers of destruction reactivates in response to some unknown stimulus or rallying call, and when this happens, woe be unto any who stand in its way.
While the guthallath’s ancient enemies are gone, it is an engine of pure destruction, designed to rampage for weeks or even months. While not intelligent enough to enjoy or regret its acts, the guthallath cannot be reasoned with—it is unaffected by most magic, and is unpredictable in how it selects its targets (and creatures it spares).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Gylou (Handmaiden Devil).
Though gylous are deeply entrenched in the expansive and complex machinations of Hell, they are highly skilled agents capable of nuanced diplomacy, masterful deception, physical finesse, and nearly any other tasks they set their minds to. This versatility has led to gylous becoming widespread throughout all layers of Hell, enabling them to filter key information to their masters regarding other devils' plots and schemes. Their allegiance is no secret, but their skills are so great that powerful devils employ one or more gylous regardless. While most gylous have a feminine form (combined with their role, this is the source of their common moniker of “handmaiden”), some have other gender presentations, and nearly all gylous take on carefully cultivated illusions to best suit the roles they fill. More often than not, gylous arise when lesser devils who have demonstrated exceptional utility and invaluable skills are uplifted into a new form, though on rare occasions they are shaped from the souls of evil mortals who showed unparalleled savvy within bureaucratic enterprises.
At any one time, eight archdevils rule the eight upper layers of Hell, while the deepest layer is ruled by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a unique demigod with a dedicated role in guiding the infernal machine forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city. Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries, and Belial designs new weapons for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the oldest archdevil and keeper of many secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs armies. Baalzebul is a brooding archdevil who has fallen from Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty Mephistopheles was formed from the plane of Hell itself.
Many unique and powerful devils hold positions of power in Hell. The most numerous of these are the infernal dukes, many of whom were promoted to this position from already impressive statures as pit fiends. The supreme ruler of Hell itself is Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness. Between these two tiers rule the eight archdevils—see the sidebar on the facing page.
The nine layers of Hell are the planar home of all devils, and they much prefer its tyrannically ordered environs to anywhere else in the multiverse. Yet devils can be encountered anywhere mortals can be tempted by infernal bargains or seek diabolic aid. On Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is particularly aligned with Hell. Its government is based upon Hellʼs organization, and the state church is that of Asmodeus.
Devils view daemonsʼ constant hunt for souls as a short-sighted waste of potential, and demonsʼ chaotic destruction of society and flesh as uncivilized and obnoxious, but they do not loathe their fiendish counterparts. Indeed, most devils are more than willing to take advantage of daemons and demons as they can to further their own machinations.
Stinking, sulfurous hellfire is infused with evil. Hellfire always deals a combination of fire damage and evil damage, though the specific ratio depends on the hellfire's origin. Certain types of hellfire can impose other effects on creatures as well, such as sapping their strength or memories.
While travel to and from Hell is possible with plane shift, another way to reach and traverse the infernal realms is via hellmouths, strange living portals connecting different layers or even different planes. A hellmouth takes the form of a grimacing face, distended maw, or other distressingly organic aperture, and no two share the same appearance. Most are carefully guarded, but some new or well-hidden hellmouths have yet to be discovered.
The devils presented on these pages are a small sampling of the torments Hell has to offer. Other devils, like the inquisition-focused bone devils, the cherub-faced and fly-bodied accuser devils, and the aquatic drowning devil are a few examples of these widespread immortal creatures.
The four queens of the night wield great power in the Pit. Ardad Lili is a plotter and manipulator with ambitions of ruling the heavens, while Doloras revels in suffering. Most distant is Mahathallah, watching over fate and death. Mightiest among them is Eiseth, who is assembling an army in Dis in the hopes of claiming the iron throne of Malebolge.
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little use for compassion or empathy. As such, it exists entirely within a strict hierarchy, and this order extends to its denizens. While different types of demons correspond to various sins and daemons are associated with modes of mortal death, the different types of devils exist solely to fulfill particular roles in the infernal machine. On occasion, a particular devil can transcend the role for which they were literally shaped, but this often transforms the devil physically into the type suitable for their new role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hadrosaurid.
Hadrosaurids are a broad grouping of herbivorous dinosaurs that share characteristic flat snouts filled with rows of grinding teeth well suited for feeding on vegetation. Also known as “duck-billed dinosaurs” due to the unusual shape of their jaws, hadrosaurids are lumbering creatures that can rival an elephant for size, although they tend to be much less aggressive and are prone to flight when confronted with danger rather than stubbornly standing their ground. Many species of hadrosaurids have uniquely shaped crests on their heads that give each species its own unusual profile, making them easily recognizable even to an amateur dinosaur watcher.
Giants and other oversized creatures have been known to domesticate hadrosaurids to serve as livestock. Despite their ability to sprint quickly, they don't make particularly viable mounts due to their timid natures, but in a large group, a panicked gathering of hadrosaurids can wreak great damage with their trampling.
A hadrosaurid can walk for short distances on its hind legs but prefers to graze and travel on all fours. The typical hadrosaurid is 20 to 30 feet long and can weigh up to 10,000 pounds.
While the real world fossil records hold a wealth of inspiration for the reconstruction of dinosaurs in an RPG, you can also look to living creatures for ideas. Giving a dinosaur a poisonous bite or an unusual attack routine like Clobbering Charge ensures that dinosaurs are as interesting in combat as they are in appearance.
As with most animals, dinosaurs can be tamed or domesticated, but the difficulty of this task increases along with the dinosaur’s level. Lizardfolk and orcs are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, workhorses, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In certain cities, dinosaurs are popularly featured as combatants in blood sports and other gladiatorial battles.
As animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear. Dinosaurs can also be harvested for rare and valuable trophies such as teeth, talons, armor plates, and the like.
At first glance, the inclusion of dinosaurs in a fantasy setting might seem strange, but dinosaurs are an excellent creature to use in a game that bridges the gap between familiar real-world animals and legendary monsters. If having dinosaurs mix freely with lions, manticores, and dragons still seems strange to you, consider having them dwell in remote, primeval lands, as suggested in the sidebars on pages 99–100. On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in the wilder regions of the world, particularly on the continent of Garund, though they are common enough that PCs might find some on display in a menagerie in a northern city, in use as guardian creatures, or even kept by druids as loyal animal companions.
Another classic place that dinosaurs are found in fiction are in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal place to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day‑night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam.
In a fantasy setting, magical effects or supernatural influences can enhance dinosaurs by giving them unexpected attacks, modes of movement, or other abilities. You can quickly create a memorable magical beast simply by giving a dinosaur the magical attack of another creature of an equal level, such as a spinosaurus gaining an acidic breath weapon akin to that of an adult black dragon.
A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or a quick online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well. Armor-headed pachycephalosaurs, spike-thumbed iguanodons, duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed spinosauruses, and more await discovery by those who would seek out the mysteries of the lost worlds where the thunder lizards still rule!
Dinosaurs fit well into certain types of settings. They’re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hamatula (Barbed Devil).
Hamatulas are forged in Erebus to protect infernal vaults from those foolish enough to try to rob the archdevil Mammon. In case the vicious spines protruding from their bodies and ability to teleport weren't deadly enough, they are also clever wielders of warding glyphs. They are effective conjured guardians, though they resent being pulled away from their duties in Hell. Unlike most fiends, hamatulas are formed from several souls that lack any features distinctive enough to merit another role.

The four queens of the night wield great power in the Pit. Ardad Lili is a plotter and manipulator with ambitions of ruling the heavens, while Doloras revels in suffering. Most distant is Mahathallah, watching over fate and death. Mightiest among them is Eiseth, who is assembling an army in Dis in the hopes of claiming the iron throne of Malebolge.
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little use for compassion or empathy. As such, it exists entirely within a strict hierarchy, and this order extends to its denizens. While different types of demons correspond to various sins and daemons are associated with modes of mortal death, the different types of devils exist solely to fulfill particular roles in the infernal machine. On occasion, a particular devil can transcend the role for which they were literally shaped, but this often transforms the devil physically into the type suitable for their new role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Harpy.
Harpies are filthy amalgamations of human and bird, resembling feral humans with wings, talons, and mouths full of sharp teeth. They use captivating songs to lure creatures in, then murder them while they stand transfixed. They enjoy causing confusion and fear in their prey before they strike, believing it creates a savory flavor in the flesh. Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer sapient prey—humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins if sufficiently hungry, they dislike their flavor and avoid eating them if possible. This doesn’t comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies. Because their aeries often reek with the gore of their kills and careless spatters of guano, harpies carry a distinctly vile scent that canny travelers associate with danger. Harpies who roost close to civilization make better efforts to keep clean, though these efforts have mixed results.
Harpies live in family groups or larger clans. They are lightweight despite their size, standing 5 feet tall and weighing only around 90 pounds. While most use relatively simple weapons, some harpies take pride in learning and mastering the use of more complex tools of war such as swords and slings. Those who master the use of the bow, in particular, are often regarded as heroes among their kind and terrors among their victims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Harrow Doll.
Harrow dolls are unique constructs that can make predictions about the future. The more elite circuses and traveling shows frequently feature a harrow doll, and many use the doll’s abilities to learn more about locals to better customize shows to their tastes—or to find easy marks for later cons. Upset patrons that try to harm a harrow doll or reclaim their payment quickly learn that the construct is more than capable of defending itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hellcat.
Hellcats are devious predators native to the fiery pits of Hell. While the fiendish creatures appears as skeletal smilodons, their bones smoking with heat and dripping with boiling blood, they are not undead. They are living hellspawn with transparent flesh that reveals their burning skeletons. A typical hellcat is 9 feet long and weighs 1,000 pounds.
Left to their own devices, hellcats spend their time hunting—that is, seeking and stalking prey just for the thrill of the chase. As fiendish creatures, they do not require mortal sustenance, but they do devour their prey for the sheer pleasure of inflicting pain. They are also far more intelligent than most assume, and they resent being treated as unintelligent animals; those who treat a hellcat as a one may find themself made into a trophy for its pack, as a hellcat goes to great lengths to coordinate elaborate revenge upon those who fail to show proper respect.
Though they can't speak, hellcats know Infernal and can communicate by telepathy with any creature capable of speech. They rarely say much except to make whispered threats and to acknowledge the orders of their diabolic masters.
Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly outmatched or up against foes they're unable to reach, but they never forget prey that escapes them. They often track potential victims and recruit allies, including other hellcats, to make coordinated attacks or ambushes against their foes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hellcrown.
The life of a Hellknight is bloody, brutal, and often short. Many who perish in service to a Hellknight order are glad to rest after having served their masters so faithfully, but others seek to continue their work even in death. When a Hellknight is decapitated, the ghostly undead known as a hellcrown is an occasional result. Consumed by the desire to bring about order by inflicting cruelty, hellcrowns haunt battlefields and abandoned castles, slaying all they encounter. A strange fusion of spirit and steel, a hellcrown has no corporeal form by itself, but instead inhabits the helmet it so proudly wore in life. Dangling from the helmet like a shroud is a shadow of the former Hellknight’s spine, adding to the creature’s terrifyingly gruesome appearance. Hellknights regard hellcrowns with a mixture of disgust and respect, considering the individuals who transform into these floating undead to have been resolute in purpose but weak in body.
A hellcrown usually manifests hours or longer after its body’s death, and only when its body is unattended; this might even take days if the Hellknight perished in a major battle. Typically, no recognizable fragment of the Hellknight’s former personality survives the grisly transformation into a hellcrown, but in rare and particularly tragic cases a hellcrown might remember its life and hold grudges against those it views as the cause of its death. Regardless of whether they retain memories of their lives or have lost all former sense of self, hellcrowns linger around the site of their death, reminding all they encounter of the merciless principles of their order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hell Hound.
A hell hound’s appearance dismisses any doubts as to its infernal origins—flesh the color of burning pitch, teeth as sharp as any fiend's pitchfork, and a shroud of ever-burning hell are are all trademark features.
On the Material Plane, these fiends are sometimes found in the service of fire-loving monsters such as fire giants or efreet, as well as mortals who seek to tame some of the raw power of Hell. In Cheliax, Hellknights occasionally call upon hell hounds to track down fugitives and traitors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Herecite of Zevgavizeb.
Secreted away in the dark corners of unnamed libraries, necromancer’s dens, and heretical scriptoriums, obscure texts describe a horrifying ritual that combines sacrifice and suffering to create a powerful undead being known as a herecite. These monsters, stripped of personal will or desire, are born into the service of an evil god whom they worship unerringly and untiringly, often in spite of any opposing religious leanings they may have had in life. Every herecite harbors an unquenchable self-hatred because it was defiled by such a foul resurrection—a rage it turns outward in an attempt to rob others of their faith and lives.
Herecites often outlast the cults that create them. Stranded herecites are drawn to others of their kind, even if they are dedicated to different evil deities, and when brought together they perform rites to magically bind themselves in a group known as a cabal. While cabal members share enhanced magic and defenses, induction into a cabal appears to hold even deeper significance for herecites. The presence of others of their kind with whom they can pray—in verses warped to venerate wicked gods—seems the only solace these tormented beings can find in undeath. Such a fellowship of sorrow is nigh unbreakable, as many an overzealous crusader has discovered far too late.
Customarily found within heavily modified temples to the pantheon of gods they collectively worship, herecites act in service to their creators or as protectors of unholy ground. High priests of different evil gods may even trade herecites among themselves, allowing their minions to form cabals strengthened by their varied faiths. A lone herecite cut off from its creators—often because it is the sole remnant of a destroyed temple or its master has perished—may wander far and wide in search of a cabal to join. Other times, the herecite seeks out a place sacred to the deity it worshipped in life. Whether motivated by a desire for contrition or vengeance, the end result of this baleful pilgrimage is always the desecration of the holy site and the slaughter of its congregants, who may in turn rise as lesser forms of undead.
The ritual to create a herecite demands the sacrifice of five devotees of the same non-evil god. During the ritual, the devotees’ bodies and souls meld together to form a single profane entity. Regardless of the deity it worships in undeath, the herecite always bears a debauched likeness to the god its constituent members previously worshipped. Followers of Erastil may reform into an aged man with a stag’s skull for a head, the blood of would-be hunters dripping from its monstrous fangs; worshippers of Desna might transmute into a woman weighed down by chains, her butterfly wings hacked to limp shreds.
When conflict fails, it is possible to appease a herecite by offering sacrifices and gifts. The sacrifice of a mortal is almost always sufficient for the herecite to allow supplicants passage into its temple or beyond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hezrou (Toad Demon).
Hezrous dwell in the vast and endless Abyssal swamps, mires, and waterways and are equally at home on land and in the water. A hezrou's presence has an obvious effect on nearby flora and water, causing plant life to twist and knot and infusing water with a foul odor and brackish taste—signs much easier to spot on the Material Plane than in the Abyss. Long exposure to this corruption can cause vile transformations and hideous mutations, and entire miserable communities of corrupted creatures sometimes rise in swamplands where a hezrou dwells. Hezrous themselves prefer simple pleasures, and they often waste their considerable intellect in the pursuit of comfortable places to slumber, squealing meals to eat, or objects of beauty to deface. They do not seek out cults to fawn over them but will not turn away those who seek to worship on their own. Hezrous form from the souls of those who abused and polluted their environs or neighbors, either through the introduction of toxins to the region or the insidious spread of drugs and poisons through a society.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications. For planar ally, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.
The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.
The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.
Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.
When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.
The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.
The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.
While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.
Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hill Giant.
Selfish and crude, these rough-skinned raiders are bullies and ultimately cowards. Quick-tempered and fond of violence, a hill giant gladly raids and pillages the defenseless but is quick to flee from those who are bigger, stronger, or better organized than they are. A hill giant is never above shoving or tricking one of their own kind to slow down their opponent or get the best loot.
Giants often keep an eclectic collection of treasures in their knapsacks or bags. Among these can be found a staggeringly wide range of unexpected and odd treasures and valuables.
As oversized as they are, giants tend to dwell in remote regions of the world, where they have the luxury of claiming larger territories of their own.
As with many people, giants enjoy keeping pets. Yet for giants, what constitutes a pet is often categorized as beast to others. Large animals like bears and lions, and megafauna like woolly mammoths and dinosaurs are popular, as are more magical creatures like hell hounds, manticores, griffons, and the like.
Beyond the giants detailed here, many others dwell in remote regions of the world. Marsh giants are cultists who worship strange sea deities, shadow giants have ties to the Shadow Plane, and mountain giants are horrific butchers even other giants fear.
Giants are larger-than-life foes. While many giants have themes that tie them to elemental or magical forces, the primary theme giants share is that they embody a classic cultural trope as their basis. Fire giants, for example, can be seen as oversized smiths, while hill giants should evoke the flavor of an oversized bully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hippocampus.
Hippocampi serve as steeds for aquatic humanoids or roam wild in the sea.
Hippocampi are highly prized by undersea societies and surface dwellers alike, as they are as easy to train as horses and serve many of the same functions, be that as beasts of burden, war-trained mounts, transportation, or as pets. Though hippocampi are able to wear barding, it hampers them considerably, so most handlers outfit them with the lightest options available. More often they are trained to pull specially designed underwater chariots or sleds. Hippocampi do not to leave the water, as they are clumsy on land, can’t bear riders while flopping about on the ground, and can’t breathe air for long.
Numerous variant species of hippocampi exist, although most of them differ from the common hippocampus only in coloration. Heartier species, such as polar hippocampi, dwell exclusively in arctic waters and are best presented as hippocampi with elite adjustments.
Protecting the harbor of Absalom and the shores of Starstone Isle, the elite Wave Riders use combat-trained hippocampi as mounts. The Wave Riders harass enemy ships, defend against aquatic foes, and intercept smugglers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hippogriff.
With the proud bearing of a great raptor and the magnificence of a powerful horse, hippogriffs are thought to be an accidental fusion of creatures or perhaps the creation of a flesh-warping wizard with a keen aesthetic sense. Regardless of their original source, these animals are now a common sight in the skies above their favored plains or hill country.
Hippogriffs bear the wings, forelegs, and head of a bird of prey, with feather coloration similar to that of a hawk or eagle, though some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark-white or coal-black feathers. Their torso, hindquarters, and tail resemble those of a horse and usually are colored bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing black, pinto, or even palomino coloration.
Hippogriffs are similar in size to large horses. Much like their equine cousins, hippogriffs often have to keep wary eyes on the skies above them, as both are preferred meals for hungry griffons and wyverns. Only hippogriffs' superior speed helps protect them from these predators.
Hippogriffs are exceptionally territorial and fiercely protect the lands under their domain. They typically favor sweeping grasslands, rolling hills, and prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their homes nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, but they graze after every meal to aid in digestion.
Since hippogriff hunting habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, such communities often set bounties on hippogriffs. As a result, preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts alongside the taxidermic remains of deer, elk, and bears.
However, other communities train hippogriffs from hatching to be ridden by elite soldiers in combat— the most notable among these groups in the Inner Sea region is the Sable Company Mercenaries in the city-state of Korvosa. Attempts are sometimes made to train adult hippogriffs in the same manner, but this often proves far more difficult. Hippogriff riders must use special saddles and combat techniques that allow them to act in concert with their mount, fighting effectively while avoiding interfering with the movement of their companion's wings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hippopotamus.
Typical adult hippos move quickly on land and attack stealthily in the water. Though herbivorous, hippos are notoriously aggressive and territorial.
A hippopotamus's sweat is an unusual reddish color that can lend them an even more frightening appearance that evokes the visage of a blood-coated monster. This sweat helps to protect the hippopotamus from becoming overheated, but it also bolsters their resistance to all manner of diseases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hive Mother.
Ankhrav hive mothers are fearsome predators that one can easily distinguish from the typical ankhrav not only by their greater size, but the presence of a large pair of razor-sharp, mantis-like arms.
As if the appearance of a hungry ankhrav in a stretch of farmland isn’t bad enough, it almost always indicates the proximity of an ankhrav hive nearby. A disturbing number of ankhravs can infest a lair. However, adventurers brave enough to crawl through the tangled burrows are often rewarded with large amounts of treasure as ankhravs have a habit of dragging their victims back to the deepest corners of their den to feast, usually discarding the remains with most of the gear intact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hobgoblin Archer.
Bands of hobgoblin soldiers typically have at least one archer among their ranks. In smaller groups, the hobgoblin archer also serves as that band’s captain.
Hobgoblin society is organized along military lines, and every hobgoblin is effectively a member of the army. Each hobgoblin in a community has a rank in the military hierarchy, and individuals are naturally ambitious and obsessed with advancement. Hobgoblins are constantly expected to prove that they’re fearless, ruthless, cunning, and strong. Demonstrating such aptitudes is an individual hobgoblin’s best hope for promotion through the ranks, but failure leads only to cruel exploitation at the hands of their superiors. Though brutal, hobgoblin society is a true meritocracy, and all hobgoblins, regardless of age, gender, or birth, wield authority and earn respect from their peers based on their skill in battle. Even those individuals who serve in non-combat roles in hobgoblin society—blacksmiths, builders, cooks, messengers, quartermasters, and the like—know that they perform vital jobs that support the larger hobgoblin army, though they rarely rise above the rank of common soldier. Everyone contributes to the larger whole, ensuring that hobgoblin society is the strongest and most efficient it can be, and anyone who fails to do so is culled from the army and this hobgoblin society as dead weight. Hobgoblins don’t usually engage in trade with other races, or even with other hobgoblin tribes, preferring to take what they want by force.
Hobgoblins generally distrust magic, especially arcane magic, which they derisively call “elf magic.” In the absence of magic, they wholeheartedly embrace alchemy, combining it with their natural aptitude for engineering to great destructive effect. They grudgingly accept divine magic, due to a grudging respect for the power of healing magic in times of war.
With few exceptions, the only non-goblinoids in a hobgoblin settlement or army are slaves (or at least regarded as such). Hobgoblins occasionally make use of bugbears as assassins or spies, and most hobgoblin tribes include a small group of goblins who eke out a meager existence on the fringes of hobgoblin society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hobgoblin General.
Hobgoblin generals serve as leaders of entire armies and rulers of hobgoblin settlements. A general does not permit the luxuries of rule to soften them. They lead their forces on the field of battle and view this opportunity to excel in a fight at the head of an army as the true reward for a life spent honing one’s skills in battle.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Hobgoblin Soldier.
Soldiers make up the bulk of hobgoblin society, whether that society is a village or a military unit.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Hodag.
Because they are often described only in drunken retellings of loggers' or miners' tales, hodags are considered by many to exist only in the local folklore of remote areas. However, some individuals have actually encountered these dangerous beasts firsthand, and even fewer have lived to tell their tales.
Hodags are reptilian creatures the size of bulls. These vicious predators' long claws can tear creatures apart in seconds. Their backs sport dozens of long spines that run from their snouts all the way down the length of their powerful tails. Their wide mouths are full of sharp and twisted rows of teeth not unlike those of a shark. The hodags' rough, scaly hides carry hues of green and brown, allowing them to blend into their forest surroundings where they ambush prey. Only their glowing red eyes reveal their presence, though hodags have learned to use this to their advantage by drawing attention to their eyes in one area, then closing their eyes and stealthily moving to another area to cause their prey to misconstrue their location.
In the wintertime, when snow and ice blankets a region, hodags grow a foul-smelling coat of greasy, dark-brown fur that sprouts in tufts from between their scales. A typical hodag measures over 10 feet long from snout to tail and weighs upward of 700 pounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Homunculus.
A homunculus is a tiny servitor construct created by a crafter to serve as a spy, scout, messenger, or assistant. When a crafter first begins to study the art of creating constructs, she often crafts a homunculus first, since the creation process is simple and inexpensive due to a magical shortcut: the use of the creator’s own blood. This forges a link between the homunculus and its master, causing the homunculus to gain a spark of the creator’s intellect, as well as the same moral values and some of the creator’s basic personality traits. Homunculi left to their own devices never stray far from their masters.
In most cases, a homunculus doesn’t survive the death of its master for long. Deprived of its creator, a homunculus loses focus and grows increasingly self-destructive, and some even end up battering themselves to destruction. Rarely, a homunculus with a slain master survives the trauma with its mind intact, often seeing itself as its deceased creator’s child or successor and attempting to further its creator’s legacy as best it can. In such cases, and if the homunculus was in close proximity to its master upon that creature’s death, a portion of the dead master’s soul “infects” the surviving homunculus as it passes on to the afterlife. This doesn’t result in a truly soulbound homunculus (see sidebar), since only a fragment of the soul is left behind, but this is still enough to grant the homunculus a greater personality, free will of its own, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to speak. Over time, a few of these “awakened” homunculi even go so far as to become convinced that they are the reincarnation of their prior masters, although their actual personalities never quite reach the depth and complexity of a truly living creature. They are, at best, caricatures of the master, and at worst they become awful, bitter-minded parodies of life itself. Still, a free-willed homunculus might pursue studies in its creator’s class, becoming a unique creature with the abilities of that class if time and fortune permit.
Homunculi are created from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, spring water, and a pint of the creator’s own blood. It is possible for a separate donor to provide the blood, but the process is more difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Horned Archon.
Horned archons are secretive and tireless sentinels and scouts, patrolling the Outer Sphere’s untamed wilds for evil to eliminate and keeping small communities safe from demons, devils, and worse. They resemble muscular humans with the head, horns, and legs of a stag. When requested to do so by their patrons, especially Erastil, they journey to the Material Plane and patrol dangerous frontier areas, secretly performing acts of kindness such as leading hunters to food, helping lost children, and driving off evil creatures. Because they roam the wilds of Nirvana and Elysium, horned archons are among the best at understanding the perspectives of other celestials.
Archons live in the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven. They manifest in the Garden at the mountain’s peak from mortal souls who answer a mysterious voice. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms. Intensely orderly in their metamorphosis, new archons begin as lantern archons or other lesser forms, transforming into ever-greater archons as their virtue and achievements grow. Each archon represents a particular virtue, such as hope, charity, justice, or courage, and they gain strength in the presence of mortals who exemplify this virtue. Due to their extremely lawful nature, archons sometimes find themselves at odds with azatas.
While archons do not seek to gather or maintain wealth, they do appreciate beauty and art, and their domains are often decorated with valuable crafts and creative works. Their armor and weapons are similarly ornate, and they always clean and polish their gear after battle. Archons value order—and thus tidiness—in all things.
As with angels and azatas, the most powerful of archons are a caste of demigods known collectively as empyreal lords. Each archon empyreal lord is a unique and powerful creature that keeps a domain somewhere in Heaven and is worshipped on Material Plane worlds. Archon divinities serve a variety of goals and focus on different aspects of righteousness. Some, such as Zohls, hold influence over the pursuit of truth and determined investigations, while others, like Damerrich, the demigod of executions, emphasize the punishment of unrepentant wrongdoers and seek to obliterate evil in all its forms.
When a spirit becomes an archon, they usually start as a lantern archon, the lowliest of archonkind. As they perform noble deeds and bolster their pureness of heart, an archon evolves into greater forms, possibly skipping stages or remaining in others for long spans of time, depending on their particular strengths and personality.
While commonly found in Heaven, archons can also be encountered on the fiendish planes in their endless crusade against evil. On the Material Plane they are usually encountered as advisors or saviors to those in need.
Always ready to defend others, most archons are never encountered out of their suits of armor. Even those who eschew armor, such as the bastion archon, tend to still appear as if they are wearing heavy protection against the scourge of battle.
Archons reside in Heaven, a plane that appears as a single massive mountain. Heaven is broken into seven tiers, with most archons occupying the second level and base of army operations, Proelera, or the sixth level, Iudica, the administrative heart of Heaven.
Many other archons than those presented here patrol Heaven or crusade in the fiendish planes, including the resolute hound archon soldiers and sentinels, and the supreme bastion archons, who rank among Heaven’s most powerful defenders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hound Archon.
Among the rank-and-file soldiers of Heaven's armies, few individuals are more dependable and truer to the cause than the noble hound archons, embodiments of the virtue of diligence. Unlike horned archons, who perform at a similar level along Heaven's grand hierarchy, hound archons do not scout ahead for evil or perform reconnaissance missions in hostile territory. A hound archon's role is as a soldier in the heart of battle or, occasionally, as a sentinel tasked with protecting a particular strategic location or holy site.
Archons live in the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven. They manifest in the Garden at the mountain’s peak from mortal souls who answer a mysterious voice. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms.

Some, such as Zohls, hold influence over the pursuit of truth and determined investigations, while others, like Damerrich, the demigod of executions, emphasize the punishment of unrepentant wrongdoers and seek to obliterate evil in all its forms.
When a spirit becomes an archon, they usually start as a lantern archon, the lowliest of archonkind. As they perform noble deeds and bolster their pureness of heart, an archon evolves into greater forms, possibly skipping stages or remaining in others for long spans of time, depending on their particular strengths and personality.
While commonly found in Heaven, archons can also be encountered on the fiendish planes in their endless crusade against evil. On the Material Plane they are usually encountered as advisors or saviors to those in need.
Always ready to defend others, most archons are never encountered out of their suits of armor. Even those who eschew armor, such as the bastion archon, tend to still appear as if they are wearing heavy protection against the scourge of battle.
Archons reside in Heaven, a plane that appears as a single massive mountain. Heaven is broken into seven tiers, with most archons occupying the second level and base of army operations, Proelera, or the sixth level, Iudica, the administrative heart of Heaven.
Many other archons than those presented here patrol Heaven or crusade in the fiendish planes, including the resolute hound archon soldiers and sentinels, and the supreme bastion archons, who rank among Heaven’s most powerful defenders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hound Of Tindalos.
Lean and athirst, the hounds of Tindalos are drawn to those who tamper with the flow of time, travel through time, or use magic or rare alchemical drugs to send their thoughts or perception back or forward in time. Powerful spellcasters can draw them from the Dimension of Time via rare rituals, but doing so attracts the hounds' ire, so few who traffic in such rituals live long enough to spread their knowledge. While the hounds possess great cunning and cruel intellect, they rarely interact with other creatures—other than to hunt and destroy those who have attracted their unblinking attention.
Once a hound catches scent of a mortal to hunt, it calls others of its ilk. The pack then pursues its victim through all space and time until it catches, slays and devours them. Those pursued can escape only by avoiding all angles, as hounds of Tindalos could step through them from nothingness at any time.
Ancient texts refer to these relentless temporal hunters as the hounds of Tindalos, yet they never seem to explore what Tindalos actually is. In some references, the implication is that Tindalos is one of the Great Old Ones or Outer Gods, but if this is the case, it is among the most obscure of these entities. Other tomes refer as Tindalos as a location, perhaps even a city or nation that once existed before time began and that can be reached only by methods impossible for any creature bound by the laws of time. In all likelihood, both and neither are right—what Tindalos is may simply be impossible for mortal minds to comprehend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hunting Spider.
Hunting spiders are the most common type of giant spider, though not the largest.
Though they are vermin incapable of forming true alliances, spiders show up alongside many types of creatures, including web lurkers. Spellcasters sometimes call upon spiders using summon animal, and spider swarms have a way of popping up just about anywhere at the most inopportune times.
A staggering number of species of giant spider exist in the world. Some, like the dream spider, whose venom creates strange hallucinations, are relatively small. Others, like the lumbering ogre spider, are larger than horses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hyaenodon.
Hyaenodons are the ferocious primeval cousins of the smaller hyena. Looming, shaggy-furred creatures nearly the size of a horse, hyaenodons are truly formidable predators to be reckoned with, due both to their size and to their bone-crushing jaws. Gnoll clans find these creatures particularly useful as mounts and guardians.
The hyena’s intense cunning, combined with its unnerving laughter, has caused hyenas to become associated with all manner of evil—hyenas are claimed to rob graves, steal children, and wield sinister supernatural powers. Though normal hyenas are no more malicious than any other natural predator, their unearned reputation often causes witches, warlords, and ill-natured creatures to seek out hyenas as pets or guard animals. The fact that gnolls in particular have a special preference for hyenas, considering the animals to be close relatives, does little to improve the animal’s already-poor reputation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hydra.
Hydras are multiheaded, foul-tempered serpentine beasts with voracious appetites, widely feared for their regeneration abilities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Hyena.
Hyenas are cunning, powerfully built carnivores that bear a heavy resemblance to dogs and other canines, though they are not themselves canines. Though all hyenas are often maligned as cowardly carrion eaters, their tactics depend on their specific breed: spotted hyenas are active pack hunters that kill most of their prey themselves, while striped and brown hyenas are more likely to be scavengers. Their jaws are exceptionally powerful, allowing hyenas to seize a victim and pull it to the rest of the pack.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Ice Golem.
Ice golems are either carved from massive blocks of ice, or pieced together from individual components that are then fused together through heat and refreezing. In most cases, the resulting shape is little more than a crude approximation of a humanoid form, but given the right talent, an ice golem could be an exquisitely carved statue of a mythical creature, famous persona, or even a deity.
While ice golems most frequently serve as guardians in freezing climates, the magic that holds an ice golem together keeps it from melting in warmer temperatures. This, combined with the fact that ice golems lie on the lower end of the scale as far as cost and difficulty to create, gives these constructs unusual features that puts them in great demand. The rich and powerful in hot, arid regions often commission ice golems not only as guardians for their estates and vaults, but for comfort—the presence of an ice golem standing quietly sentinel in the corner of a room can help to keep the chamber at a comfortable temperature. The truly decadent use ice golems as servants to keep drinks cold.
Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called “golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.
Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell can affect the golem.
Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.
Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.
Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ice Linnorm.
The ice linnorm dwells amid glacial crevasses, atop wind-blasted mountain peaks, or within glittering caverns carved from the hearts of the mightiest of icebergs.
The death curses of the linnorms are often the subjects of tragic sagas, and those who would think themselves vanquishing heroes for slaying a linnorm often meet their dooms soon thereafter, succumbing to these curses well after the death of the linnorm responsible for bestowing it.
Linnorms have a deep connection to the First World, the primordial home of the fey. While linnorms typically won't think twice before devouring a gnome or other fey, they do have an unusual respect for wielders of powerful primal magic. The only way to cow a linnorm, according to common wisdom, is to remind it that there are forces of nature even stronger than itself.
In the storied Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the slaying of a linnorm is traditionally required for those who would claim a nation’s crown. Recently, though, the Linnorm King White Estrid claimed her crown not by slaying a linnorm but by beating it into submission, gaining a powerful and dangerous ally to help secure her rule.
Creatures as powerful as linnorms tend to spawn stories of their own, accurate or not. Critical failure on a check to Recall Knowledge on linnorms might suggest that you can avoid a linnorm's death curse by closing your eyes as you deliver the fatal blow, or that rubbing poison oak on yourself can ward off a linnorm's attention.
As with true dragons, linnorms tend to amass immense piles of treasure in their lairs. These hoards consist of the weapons, gear, and belongings of would-be vanquishers more often than minted coins or works of art.
Almost all linnorms lead solitary lives; they are too reprehensible for even their own kind to tolerate for any length of time. Most species do not even meet to reproduce; rather, female linnorms usually deposit a solitary egg in a remote location, which a wandering male linnorm then fertilizes and places in a nook suitable for incubation. Newborn linnorms range in size from that of adult crocodiles to full-grown bulls, and their growth is rapid. Even a juvenile linnorm is strong enough to wreak havoc on a small settlement— though most don't dare to commit such audacious pillaging, for fear of evoking the anger of another, larger linnorm in the area.
Linnorms exist in a variety of forms beyond the four detailed here. The gaunt cairn linnorm, the spiny taiga linnorm, and the aquatic fjord linnorm each terrorize their own specific regions of the Material Plane.
While the linnorms presented here and in the first Bestiary constitute the majority of these creatures, others exist, particularly in the remote regions of the First World. It may be that these rare linnorms simply find the Material Plane too constraining for their might!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ice Mephit.
Though capable of the same depths of cruelty as their fire mephit kin, ice mephits carry theirs out in a more calculating way. Unlike most mephits, these pale blue mephits prefer solitude to company. Lacking in empathy, they are known for their callousness, and have a reputation for brutal honesty. They also have few moral qualms about acting selfishly and exploiting weakness for their own gain, should the chance arise.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Mephits are a favorite target for low-level spellcasters to summon, both because they have several useful abilities and because they are relatively easy to command and manipulate. Still, care must be taken when using mephits as minions, because if left unwatched or unattended for too long, they can cause all sorts of mischief.
Different types of mephits that can be found on the same elemental plane often develop friendly (or, in some cases, fierce) rivalries with one another. While mephits from elementally opposed planes (such as fire and water) may have strong opinions about the superiority of their own element, the fact that they rarely see such mephits means that when they do encounter them, they often get along better than they do with their close neighbors.
Perhaps because they're so often compelled into service by mortal conjurers and more powerful elementals, mephits tend to adopt long names peppered with self-proclaimed titles and imagined or exaggerated accomplishments to alleviate their feelings of inadequacy. Some examples of mephit names follow. Anothoraxia, Lurker in Dark Places, the Tragic Hero, One Against AllSilothiscil the Embittered, Rimelord of the Eternal Chill, Lord of IciclesOglophax, Prince of Pungency, the Viscous One, the Forever StainZarnozath the Magnificent, First of His Name, Boiler of Kettles, the Teapot Terror
The four mephits presented here are but the most common of their kind. Others that rise from the mixing of elemental energies exist as well: creatures like dust mephits (who breathe out a scouring cloud of grit), ice mephits (who spit out sickening gusts of frozen air), magma mephits (which can assume the form of a pool of lava), ooze mephits (which spit out foul-smelling acid), salt mephits (who can draw moisture out of the environs and nearby creatures), and steam mephits (which can call down tiny squalls of boiling rain).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Icewyrm.
Resembling wingless, serpentine dragons formed of jagged ice and shot through with veins of nearly frozen water, these elementals dwell within icebergs and enjoy striking out at passing ships or creatures. They're especially common in frigid stretches of ocean in the Plane of Water, where icebergs cluster together into enormous islands of ice.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Though fire and water classically oppose one another, in the right mixture they can become a dangerous combination. Water elementals heated to a scalding temperature through natural factors such as underwater volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent fire damage with their Strikes, while fire elementals infused with moisture might exude clouds of obscuring or even blinding steam.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Icicle Snake.
Translucent and capable of hanging suspended and near motionless, icicle snakes sense the heat of living creatures as a threat and attempt to use their camouflage and chilling bite against foes.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Iffdahsil.
The slithering horror known as Iffdahsil is an undead shoggoth that has haunted the vault of the Black Desert for millennia. Drow legends in particular tend to feature Iffdahsil, terrifying the elves from a young age.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ifrit.
Ifrits' blood blazes with elemental fire. Most ifrits are second-class citizens who serve under the iron heel of the efreeti and their Dominion of Flame, but those born outside the efreet hierarchy or who choose to flee it live lives of passion in search of fame, glory, and power.
Ifrits are fond of fire, but this doesn't mean they all embrace fire's destructive nature. Those who seek more productive roles in a society find inspiration in the way flames flit and dance, and they pride themselves in their skills as acrobats or dancers. The church of Sarenrae particularly welcomes ifrit fire dancers, both in appreciation of their skill and to help ensure these ifrits have a safe place apart from their more violent kin.
But by and large, ifrits are drawn to professions and callings that allow them to wallow in the glories of fire. Ifrit pyrochemists apply this calling to alchemical teachings, seeing purity in every single bomb thrown or conflagration lit.
Many immortals dwell upon the other planes of the Great Beyond. Some are benevolent and kindly, like angels. Others are cruel and destructive, like demons. And some flt roles outside of morality, like psychopomps. It’s far from unheard of that mortals and immortals alike become entangled romantically, and the children of such engagements carry a supernatural element in their bloodlines for generations to follow. After the first generation, this otherworldly influence usually lies dormant, but now and then, the influence can manifest strongly in descendants many years later. These inheritors of extraplanar legacies are known collectively as planar scions.
While most geniekin planar scions live on their genie parent's ancestral plane, rare fonts of elemental power or genie activity sometimes give rise to geniekin on Golarion. By far, geniekin are most commonly found in Katapesh, as genies are more prevalent there than other regions due to the influence of genie binders.
Planar scions from the elemental planes are known as geniekin because they are overwhelmingly born from couplings between mortals and genies: ifrits are born of efreeti, oreads of shaitans, sulis of jann, sylphs of djinn, and undines of marids. Despite this distinguished ancestry, geniekin do not display most of their parents' exceptional talents, such as their ability to grant wishes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Iguanodon.
Iguanodons are large, herbivorous dinosaurs that inhabit swamps and forests where they browse on the abundant vegetation. The iguanodon is capable of moving on two feet or on four, quickly switching from one stance to the other depending on whether it needs to move through dense foliage or to reach delectable morsels hanging up in the canopy.
Although iguanodons are herbivores, they are notoriously quick to anger. Their thumb spikes make their claws particularly devastating weapons. A well-placed blow from one of these claws can turn a hungry predator into a cowering beast with one swift strike. Iguanodons are 30 feet long and weigh 6,000 pounds.
While the real world fossil records hold a wealth of inspiration for the reconstruction of dinosaurs in an RPG, you can also look to living creatures for ideas. Giving a dinosaur a poisonous bite or an unusual attack routine like Clobbering Charge ensures that dinosaurs are as interesting in combat as they are in appearance.
As with most animals, dinosaurs can be tamed or domesticated, but the difficulty of this task increases along with the dinosaur’s level. Lizardfolk and orcs are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, workhorses, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In certain cities, dinosaurs are popularly featured as combatants in blood sports and other gladiatorial battles.
As animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear. Dinosaurs can also be harvested for rare and valuable trophies such as teeth, talons, armor plates, and the like.
At first glance, the inclusion of dinosaurs in a fantasy setting might seem strange, but dinosaurs are an excellent creature to use in a game that bridges the gap between familiar real-world animals and legendary monsters. If having dinosaurs mix freely with lions, manticores, and dragons still seems strange to you, consider having them dwell in remote, primeval lands, as suggested in the sidebars on pages 99–100. On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in the wilder regions of the world, particularly on the continent of Garund, though they are common enough that PCs might find some on display in a menagerie in a northern city, in use as guardian creatures, or even kept by druids as loyal animal companions.
Another classic place that dinosaurs are found in fiction are in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal place to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day‑night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam.
In a fantasy setting, magical effects or supernatural influences can enhance dinosaurs by giving them unexpected attacks, modes of movement, or other abilities. You can quickly create a memorable magical beast simply by giving a dinosaur the magical attack of another creature of an equal level, such as a spinosaurus gaining an acidic breath weapon akin to that of an adult black dragon.
A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or a quick online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well. Armor-headed pachycephalosaurs, spike-thumbed iguanodons, duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed spinosauruses, and more await discovery by those who would seek out the mysteries of the lost worlds where the thunder lizards still rule!
Dinosaurs fit well into certain types of settings. They’re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Imentesh.
The loquacious proteans known as imenteshes serve as missionaries, spies, and heralds of chaos to further the protean goal of reality's dissolution. Imenteshes are cunning, curiously diplomatic, and profoundly whimsical. They travel beyond the Maelstrom for their work, frequently adopting extravagant personal attire and decorations that often border upon the garish, all to curry favor with less chaotic beings.
Proteans divide themselves into a loose caste system and possess a dizzying variety of powers. Most proteans have a serpentine body with the head of a primeval beast. Scholars have long been intrigued by this fact—that scions of dissolution and disorder would share so many features—pointing out that even in the purest chaos there is some semblance of order. Others note that the serpentine form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion and lack of consensus surrounding their kind. After all, if even chaos cannot be trusted to be chaotic, would that not be the purest form of entropy?
Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves. When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature. D8Warpwave Effect 1Clumsy 2 (3 on a critical failure) 2Confused and gains 4d6 temporary Hit Points 3Dazzled (permanent on a critical failure) 4Enfeebled 2 (3 on a critical failure) 5Immobilized by filaments of energy 6Quickened (Stride, Strike, or Step only) 7Slowed 1 8Stupefied 2 (3 on a critical failure)
Among the numerous types of immortals that dwell in the Great Beyond, the proteans are surely some of the oldest. They’ve waged war against the inevitable aeons from the advent of their first creation, and speak longingly of that time before the gods themselves imposed order upon reality.
The Maelstrom, home of all proteans, is the whirling mass of turbulent primal energy, planar waves, and soul-stuff that surrounds the Outer Planes. Planar scholars theorize that all of reality was originally formed from the Maelstrom in the early days of the cosmos—a theory proteans don’t necessarily dispute.
Where proteans go, chaos follows. To proteans, there is no purer form of existence than entropy, and they constantly seek to oppose the establishment of order in the Great Beyond. However, proteans don’t see life as being incompatible with chaos; rather, they simply believe beings—immortal or not—deserve complete freedom on their own terms.
Many other proteans beyond those presented here dwell in the Maelstrom, including the spectral pelagastrs, the nearly humanoid shapechanging ourdivars, and the incredibly powerful izfiitars.
The most powerful of all proteans are a group of demigods known collectively as protean lords. Yet even their vast might pales in comparison to that of the mysterious Speakers of the Depths. The Speakers are the most enigmatic of the Maelstrom’s gods—even their exact nature is unknown, and scholars disagree as to whether they are even divinities or just aspects of the Maelstrom itself.
Individual proteans have two names: a traditional name in their hissing, confusing language; and an honorary title. The latter is easily translated to other languages, but a protean’s traditional name can only rarely be uttered in any tongue other than Protean. As such, most proteans tend to go by their titles when dealing with outsiders, referring to themselves as, for example, “Song of Gentle Poison” or “Sibilant Cry of the Storm.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Immortal Ichor.
An immortal ichor is an intelligent mass of blood from a dead evil deity. The cultists who perform the ritual to create immortal ichor typically seal up the sentient ooze in an underground or remote chamber that blocks its magical abilities, but over time these seals break or weaken, freeing the unholy monster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Imp.
Imps are infiltrators and corruptors who, despite their diminutive stature, are more than capable of subtly influencing a weak-willed individual into performing increasingly evil acts over time. An imp will often agree to serve a mortal and act docile and loyal in a long-term plot to eventually damn its master’s soul to Hell. Imps are born directly from Hell itself, rather than from mortal souls, and thus they serve outside the usual diabolic hierarchy, granting them leeway to pursue their specialties. Despite standing a mere 2-feet tall, imps can be vicious combatants, flying out of reach and turning invisible to escape should the odds turn against them.
At any one time, eight archdevils rule the eight upper layers of Hell, while the deepest layer is ruled by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a unique demigod with a dedicated role in guiding the infernal machine forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city. Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries, and Belial designs new weapons for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the oldest archdevil and keeper of many secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs armies. Baalzebul is a brooding archdevil who has fallen from Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty Mephistopheles was formed from the plane of Hell itself.
Many unique and powerful devils hold positions of power in Hell. The most numerous of these are the infernal dukes, many of whom were promoted to this position from already impressive statures as pit fiends. The supreme ruler of Hell itself is Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness. Between these two tiers rule the eight archdevils—see the sidebar on the facing page.
The nine layers of Hell are the planar home of all devils, and they much prefer its tyrannically ordered environs to anywhere else in the multiverse. Yet devils can be encountered anywhere mortals can be tempted by infernal bargains or seek diabolic aid. On Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is particularly aligned with Hell. Its government is based upon Hellʼs organization, and the state church is that of Asmodeus.
Devils view daemonsʼ constant hunt for souls as a short-sighted waste of potential, and demonsʼ chaotic destruction of society and flesh as uncivilized and obnoxious, but they do not loathe their fiendish counterparts. Indeed, most devils are more than willing to take advantage of daemons and demons as they can to further their own machinations.
Stinking, sulfurous hellfire is infused with evil. Hellfire always deals a combination of fire damage and evil damage, though the specific ratio depends on the hellfire's origin. Certain types of hellfire can impose other effects on creatures as well, such as sapping their strength or memories.
While travel to and from Hell is possible with plane shift, another way to reach and traverse the infernal realms is via hellmouths, strange living portals connecting different layers or even different planes. A hellmouth takes the form of a grimacing face, distended maw, or other distressingly organic aperture, and no two share the same appearance. Most are carefully guarded, but some new or well-hidden hellmouths have yet to be discovered.
The devils presented on these pages are a small sampling of the torments Hell has to offer. Other devils, like the inquisition-focused bone devils, the cherub-faced and fly-bodied accuser devils, and the aquatic drowning devil are a few examples of these widespread immortal creatures.
The four queens of the night wield great power in the Pit. Ardad Lili is a plotter and manipulator with ambitions of ruling the heavens, while Doloras revels in suffering. Most distant is Mahathallah, watching over fate and death. Mightiest among them is Eiseth, who is assembling an army in Dis in the hopes of claiming the iron throne of Malebolge.
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little use for compassion or empathy. As such, it exists entirely within a strict hierarchy, and this order extends to its denizens. While different types of demons correspond to various sins and daemons are associated with modes of mortal death, the different types of devils exist solely to fulfill particular roles in the infernal machine. On occasion, a particular devil can transcend the role for which they were literally shaped, but this often transforms the devil physically into the type suitable for their new role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Intellect Devourer.
Intellect devourers serve as advance scouts and infiltrators for the powerful force of alien beings called the Dominion of the Black. These monsters roam the Darklands, from which they mount secret invasions of the world above. When an intellect devourer infiltrates a society, its first priority is to acquire a body. It might first seek out a graveyard for a fresh corpse, as this is easier than fighting and killing someone. When the aberration compresses itself into the host's brain cavity, its real body goes dull to sensation as it connects to the nervous system of its host. If found out, an intellect devourer might quickly inhabit a new body to make its escape, preferably something inconspicuous such as a domestic animal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Interlocutor.
Interlocutors are the most talented surgeon-sculptors of the velstracs, carving away flesh and replacing it with new body parts of muscle, sinew, and metal. Each interlocutor structures their individual appearance carefully, but all are towering, multi-limbed amalgamations of the strongest limbs, densest bone, and sharpest metal they can find. They continually search for new material to graft to their forms, and their slain foes are rarely found intact, as little is more valuable to interlocutors than a powerful opponent's legs, eyes, or even brain. Interlocutors average 9 feet tall and weigh approximately 800 pounds.
Velstracs manifest from the souls of masochistic or sadistic mortals that are diverted into the Shadow Plane and then forged into forms that suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the aesthetics-obsessed interlocutors.
Some mortals refer to velstracs as “kytons,” a misattribution that the velstracs tolerate with cold amusement. The term “kyton” denotes a master or virtuoso among their kind, and these fiends enjoy being labeled masters of their horrid paths to perfection through agony.

Velstracs originated with the first debased thoughts of mortals, which the gods found so deplorable that they locked all velstracs away in Hell. It wasn’t long, however, before the newly formed race of velstracs escaped their infernal prison to the Shadow Plane.

Scholars grimly joke that there are as many different kinds of velstracs as there are ways to skin a cat. The relatively diminutive cantor velstrac poisons the minds of its victims so that they believe they are being clawed from the inside out. The mighty eremites, on the other hand, seek out the most powerful beings to subsume into their own form and lord over all other velstracs save the demagogues.
There are as many different velstracs as there are ways to inflict pain. Other velstracs range in power from the relatively weak lampadariuses to the powerful phylacators.
Many velstracs outsource the forging of their chains to unique velstracs known as almoners. These six-armed, legless humanoids toil endlessly at a great burning foundry called the Shadow Forge. Almoners operate under mysterious strictures, and are just as likely to turn a velstrac away empty-handed as not.
Many velstracs forge their own chains, but others outsource the task to unique velstracs known as almoners. These blind, deaf, and mute velstracs resemble six-armed halflings severed at the waist that toil away endlessly at a great burning foundry called the Shadow Forge. Almoners operate under mysterious strictures, and are just as likely to turn a velstrac away empty-handed as they are to hand one a finely crafted chain before the request has even been uttered.
The most powerful velstracs are unique divinities known collectively as demagogues—powerful creatures often worshipped by mortals who seek to experience agonizing new revelations and gain power by enhancing the body through pain.

Velstracs are most often encountered in the shadowy realm of Nidal, where the state worship of Zon-Kuthon is rigidly enforced. Indeed, many velstracs are created from the souls of Joyful Things, devotees of Zon-Kuthon who have had their limbs amputated to focus their minds on the veneration of pain, sacrifice, and torment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Invidiak (Shadow Demon).
For most demons, possessing a creature requires a ritual, magic item, or condition, but for invidiaks, who lack a body, possession is akin to donning a suit of clothing. Known also as shadow demons, invidiaks are formed from envious mortal souls.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications. For planar ally, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.
The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.
The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.
Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.
When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.
The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.
The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.
While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.
Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Invisible Stalker.
Invisible stalkers have a poor opinion of mortals due to the unsavory nature of the violent tasks summoners usually call them to the Material Plane to perform.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Iridescent Animal.
An iridescent animal is a wild or domesticated animal that has undergone a magical transformation to become a luminescent beast that can glow in the dark and use dazzling light-based powers. Although the effect is glamorous, the life of an iridescent animal is a sad one. The change drastically weakens the animal, diminishing both its strength and its vitality. This effect is desirable for some—particularly the circuses, menageries, and royal courts that typically purchase these glowing beasts—but never for the animal itself. Because the effects of the transformation are so deleterious, the act of creating an iridescent animal is strongly frowned upon by druids and other naturalists, some of whom dedicate their lives to rescuing and fostering these maltreated creatures. The procedure cannot be reversed, and few iridescent animals are fit to live in the wild after the transformation, cementing their lot in life to serve as showy beasts of burden or objects of entertainment and ridicule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Irlgaunt.
Irlgaunts resemble titanic spiders or crabs, but with cephalopod-like tendrils erupting from the tips of their chitin-armored legs. Their jagged gray shells allow them to blend into the rocky walls of the high mountain passes and deep ravines that serve as their hunting grounds. Despite their size, they move with incredible alacrity, bounding across chasms and skittering up sheer mountain cliffs without pause. Though they are formidable in melee, irlgaunts have an even more powerful ranged attack. These creatures can pelt their opponents by forcefully regurgitating gastroliths—melon-sized clusters of rocks enveloped in coagulated digestive enzymes strong enough to break down flesh and bone. Gastroliths are fragile and explode on contact, spraying the area with shards of rock and caustic acid.
While one might easily mistake an irlgaunt for a simple brutish beast, they have a keen intelligence and use devious hunting strategies. They set traps for travelers and are fond of using gems and magical items taken from previous victims as bait. They have been known to start rockslides or otherwise block passages to reroute explorers into their clutches. They also use their gastroliths to direct the movements of their prey, forcing victims into dead ends at the edge of chasms or cliffs.
For the most part, irlgaunts live solitary lives, likely because finding enough food to sustain a community tends to be difficult. However, they still maintain a sense of extended, regional community, actively gathering when organizing for war or to discuss other issues that affect their species or shared territories. They have been known to occasionally ally with giants, but these truces are usually nebulous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Irnakurse.
Irnakurse are surface elves who drow have subjected to particularly cruel and humiliating fleshwarping practices, as drow take special delight in the torment of their surface-dwelling kin. The process of crafting an irnakurse involves twisting an unfortunate elf into a deformed mass of misplaced limbs, loose flesh, and bony protrusions—parts that should be internal are often left on full display to the world. Irnakurse are subject to mental conditioning that causes them to hate their prior forms, and these creatures prefer to attack surface elves over all other targets.
Not every fleshwarp emerges from its vat capable of survival. Many perish within minutes, as organs fundamental for life simply fail or collapse in on themselves. Fleshwarpers can usually recycle failed fleshwarps back into the mix quickly enough, but now and then, remnants known as fleshdregs are stable enough to live pain-wracked lives of their own. These foul creatures often infest fleshwarper holdings, like rats or other vermin do in less awful locations.
Grothluts may be the weakest example of a fleshwarp, and driders the most successful, but others exist as well. Ghonhatines are lumbering fleshwarps formed from xulgaths, while the tentacled irnakurses are formed from surface-dwelling elves. Sinspawn are fleshwarps as well, of course, although their methods of creation differ drastically from the techniques mastered by drow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Iron Golem.
Traditionally crafted into the forms of giant suits of armor or powerful animals, iron golems are products of exquisite artistry and skill. Their articulated joints and sturdy armored bodies require great care and mathematical precision to craft, and regular cleaning and oiling ensure they don’t rust over the ages. With proper care, iron golems can remain in good shape for thousands of years, being passed down for generations, as long as they aren’t destroyed by meddlesome adventurers. In addition to their incredible strength, iron golems possess a potent toxic breath weapon that is often more than enough to dispatch entire groups of opponents.
Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called “golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.
Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell can affect the golem.
Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.
Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.
Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Isqulug.
The isqulug's appearance, though unsettling, might be its least awful aspect. The creature resembles a bipedal amphibian with tentacles instead of arms and a head composed of an undulant mass of what appear to be shifting, slimy transparent eggs filled with writhing larvae. In truth, these larvae constitute the mind and consciousness of the isqulug—its “body” is little more than an organic suit manufactured from the flesh of those it has consumed, analogous to the complex web of a spider or the hive of a colony of bees, but fully capable of movement and violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Jabberwock.
Few beasts have inspired as many legends, poems, songs, and myths in as many cultures, as this bizarre draconic creature. The jabberwock hails from the fey realm of the First World and is part of a group of powerful First World creatures known collectively as the Tane.
Like all members of the Tane, jabberwocks are living creatures that age, eat, drink, and sleep, but do not reproduce normally. Instead, they are created directly by the godlike Eldest who rule the First World, and they serve at the pleasure (or frustration) of these capricious and mysterious entities. Believed to be the most powerful of all the Tane, jabberwocks are typically only ever created with one purpose: to wreak destruction and havoc upon the Material Plane. One of the Eldest might send a jabberwock to devastate a country, continent, or even entire world in order to get revenge for some slight made against them by a single mortal. Sometimes, no specific insult or injury is required, as some of the Eldest resent the very existence of the Material Plane and periodically create jabberwocks simply to express the wrath of the First World against its younger and less chaotic sibling.
Once a jabberwock arrives on the Material Plane, its first order of business is to seek out a lair. It prefers dwelling in remote forest locations about a day's flight from civilization—the more dangerous the woodland is to those who might eventually come hunting it, the better!
The relationship between jabberwocks and vorpal weapons is the subject of much debate and speculation among scholars, and the various poems, songs, and legends about the jabberwock do little to clarify the issue, conflicting and diverging on this point. Some believe that vorpal weapons were first created specifically to combat jabberwocks, but others take the story one step further. They cite evidence in certain ancient myths that there may once have been only a single, unique jabberwock, so powerful that nothing could so much as scratch it—nothing, that is, except for the first vorpal sword, crafted for that very purpose. So epic was the resulting battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these echoes, in the form of vorpal weapons, can now be found on many worlds. Those who subscribe to this belief claim that the jabberwocks seen today are but pale imitations of this proto-jabberwock, and they speculate that only the combined efforts of several Eldest would be sufficient to create such a creature again.
Variant JabberwocksThe Eldest have sometimes altered certain aspects of the jabberwocks they create. Some of the more notorious or legendary variant jabberwocks include the following.
Frumious Jabberwock: Frumious jabberwocks have two heads. They are level 24 and gain an extra action on each of their turns they can use only to make a jaws Strike.
Mimsy Jabberwock: Typically hailing from wintry regions of the First World, mimsy jabberwocks have glowing blue-white scales, resist cold instead of fire, and have eyes that burn with blue flames that deal cold damage instead of fire damage.
Slithy Jabberwock: Wreaking destruction beneath the waves, these sinuous and slimy jabberwocks are amphibious, have a swim Speed of 80 feet instead of the normal fly Speed, and do not have a wing Strike. A slithy jabberwock's whiffling aura is activated whenever it swims, makes a tail Strike, or Burbles.
Although jabberwocks may fear vorpal weapons and are filled with rage against all mortal creatures, few things invite a jabberwock's wrath more than a Material Plane dragon. Some scholars believe that in the same way the First World is believed to have been a template or “first draft” of the Material Plane, dragons were created in the likeness of jabberwocks. A jabberwock that learns of a nearby dragon will attempt to kill it to the exclusion of all other priorities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Janni.
Jann are genies composed of all four elements, meaning they are not quite home on any of the Elemental Planes. Instead, jann reside on the Material Plane, making only brief forays to the other parts of the Inner Sphere. Although they are human in size and appearance, jann are not at all related to humans and bristle at any claims to this effect. They are a proud people and take great care to maintain their honor—restoring that honor with the edge of a sword, if necessary.
Genie nobles with titles unique to their kind (as detailed in each sidebar) rule genie society. Genie nobles are generally at least 5 levels higher than a typical example of their kind. In addition to the increased statistics afforded by their higher levels, genie nobles gain additional spells. But the most wondrous (and notorious) of a genie noble’s powers is their ability to grant wishes. Any genie noble (save for jann, who lack this power) can grant a mortal or undead creature up to three wishes within a year’s time. Many unscrupulous creatures compel genie nobles to serve them, tricking them or entrapping them with magic. However, once a genie noble grants a third wish to a single creature, they are freed from service to that creature forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Jinkin.
Jinkins are sadistic tinkers who steal and sabotage items and take great pride in their power to curse precious objects. They hold grudges and create convoluted plans for revenge whenever they feel slighted, such as when a creature dares to remove one of their curses. Rarely content to wreak simple mayhem, jinkins also take immense pleasure in torture and murder, though they prefer to lead victims into traps designed to capture or incapacitate rather than kill outright. Deep pits are favorites, since victims who survive the fall face a slow death from starvation and thirst. Jinkins enjoy gathering at the edge of pits to mock, tease, and torment.
All gremlins are hoarders, and their nests are cluttered with objects both valuable and worthless. Sorting through a gremlin nest can reveal unexpected treasures like pieces of jewelry or minor magic items, but care must also be taken to avoid being cut on rusty shards of metal, picking up cursed items, or disturbing a hidden nest of venomous vermin.
Superstitious societies sometimes hang tiny bells made of semiprecious metals in the belief that such bells will dissuade gremlins from destroying an affixed object or infesting a home. Strangely enough, most gremlins believe this superstition as well, and even when a gremlin bell hasn’t been magically enhanced, a gremlin usually won’t risk tinkering with objects that seem to be protected in such a manner.
Lawful evil gremlins are sometimes drawn to the worship of archdevils, though not in an orthodox fashion. Dispater is revered as the archdevil of cities—playgrounds to engage in thievery and sabotage. Mammon is worshipped as the bringer of wealth and protector of gremlin warrens that, like his domain of Erebus, are dark and trap-filled. Neutral evil gremlins have been known to worship Norgorber in his aspect as a patron of thieves, but pugwampis in particular prefer to worship gnolls (or at least, worship whoever the local gnolls worship). Chaotic evil gremlins often revere Andirifkhu, demon lord of illusions, knives, and traps. Those that retain a connection to the First World may swear allegiance to the Lantern King, Eldest of laughter, mischief, and transmutation.
Most know better than to employ gremlins, so when the fey creatures live side-by-side with others, it's often as parasites and unwelcome guests. Imaginative and sinister folk who find themselves infested sometimes catch the gremlins and release them in the homes of their enemies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Jorogumo.
Appearing as beautiful, well-dressed humans, jorogumos lurk in high mountains and prey on travelers. These evil creatures often keep giant spiders as pets and can fully change into a giant spider or sprout spider legs from their backs. Jorogumos usually eat their prey, but some humanoids meet an even more gruesome fate as living incubators for jorogumo eggs.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Jotund Troll.
Jotund trolls are gigantic, nine-headed horrors who prowl frigid moors, marshes, and wastelands, always alone and always enraged. While each of the jotund troll's nine heads possess their own brains and senses, they work much more in tandem than the dual-minded nature of the two-headed troll. Despite this, the heads often argue and bicker, particularly over which head gets to eat. The fact that all nine maws lead to the same shared stomach makes little difference in such culinary disagreements.
Prevailing wisdom holds that the jotund troll represents a primordial, if not original, shape and design for the first trolls to plague the world, arising from a mythical realm in the Great Beyond known as Jotungard. This sprawling domain, said to be nestled in a remote reach of Elysium, is the legendary home of the deities of giant-kind. Whether the jotund troll was created in Jotungard to plague the Material Plane as punishment or challenge, or if it's merely an evocative legend told by scholars, is unknown. In any case, the jotund trolls themselves likely care little.Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager’s stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls’ capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand—a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies.
The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures’ power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll’s vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though—even the smallest scrap of a troll’s flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster’s entire body until nothing remains.
Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such “troll kings” possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well—mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous— but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood.
Particularly devout trolls, called augurs, claim to possess the so‑called “gift of sight,” which they believe was granted them by the demon lord Urxehl. Augurs practice a disturbing method of future‑telling, in which a troll slashes open its own abdomen and pulls out its entrails to interpret the prophecies in its quivering innards. Other cultists prod and agitate their gutted diviner to keep it conscious throughout the gruesome ordeal.
The blood of trolls is a valuable and difficult-to-procure substance of intense interest to alchemists, witches, and doctors the world over. Though initially it is of little interest other than its unnaturally vibrant hue, when processed correctly its applications are numerous. Experiments have produced oils that restore lost limbs, potions that grant the imbiber supernatural strength, and even smoke bombs that cause anyone caught in the haze to fly into an unstoppable rage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Jungle Drake.
Believed to be related to green dragons, jungle drakes are dangerous hunters equipped with a debilitating venom delivered by a large barbed stinger or their noxious phlegm. Their wings are equipped with vestigial claws that allow them to deftly maneuver through thick jungle foliage both in flight and on foot. Jungle drakes prefer to ambush their prey using hit-and-run tactics, picking off the weakest members of a group and dragging their victims off to finish their meals as they please.
Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.
While drake hides aren’t any more valuable than those of other, similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. While they are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.
A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.
A drake egg has Hardness 3, 5 HP, and BT 5. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.
Once a drake hatches, it imprints on the first creature that it sees. A creature imprinted on in this way gains a +5 bonus to Nature checks to train or command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the region, the type of drake, and the exact purpose the buyer has in mind, but typically depends on the level of the drake. Because drakes are evil, dangerous, and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.
It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconfidence, or general lack of skill.
Drakes reach maturity and reproduce much earlier than dragons, meaning that they are a far more common threat than their more powerful forebears. Drakes have few qualms about dwelling with one another (provided they are the same species), often establishing dens in pockets of wilderness suitable to their needs, such as swampy grottoes, shallow shoreline caves, or cliffside perches.
The allure of hunting a dragon is difficult to resist for many adventurers, but accomplishing such a task is fraught with peril. Unscrupulous adventurers have been known to instead hunt drakes and use trophies harvested from these creatures to deceive locals.
While the different species of drakes are adapted to different climates and environments, many drakes share similar preferences regarding nest location, searching out high places that offer cover from above, such as cliffside or mountaintop caverns, jungle canopies, and so on.
While every adventurer knows that dragon hide can be crafted into potent armor or weapons, drake hide holds no such intrinsic value. Nonetheless, drake scales and horns are physically impressive, and to the uneducated buyer, might seem at first glance to be legitimate. Unscrupulous leatherworkers have been known to use drake hides to craft and sell counterfeit dragonhide armor, so potential buyers should remain on the lookout for scams.
Drakes share dragon’s interest in treasure, but lack dragons’ discerning taste. A drake hoard will certainly contain coins, jewelry, gemstones, gear, and even the odd magic item or two, but the bulk of the hoard invariably consists of broken weapons, shiny rocks, bits of junk, and other doubtful pieces of refuse.
Although drakes and dragons are related to one another, little love is lost between them, and even the most territorial drakes know better than to remain in a dragon's territory longer than they have to. In rare cases, large rampages of drakes band together to attack an encroaching dragon, especially if the dragon is young and inexperienced.
The drakes presented on these pages are far from the only types that exist. Forest drakes have green hides, spit acidic clouds, and can be found in temperate woodlands. Rift drakes, among the most powerful of their kind, spit clinging caustic vapors and dwell in badlands and regions scarred by devastating magical disasters. Sea drakes can be found in oceans across the world, lava drakes in volcanic crevasses, mist drakes along coastlines and in salt marshes, and spire drakes in ragged, rocky hills. Undoubtedly, many other types of drakes lurk in the far corners of the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Jyoti.
Jyotis are sometimes called “false phoenixes” (a term they find insulting) by the ignorant or willful. These avian humanoids are native to the Positive Energy Plane. They rarely leave this enigmatic realm and view visitors from other planes as stains on the purity of their home. Jyotis particularly distrust divine spellcasters and religious warriors, seeing them as inclined to take credit for manifesting a life force that, from the jyotis' perspective, is as plentiful and ubiquitous as water is to fish.
Despite their distrust of intruders, jyotis rarely attack unprovoked when their homes are not threatened. They are intolerant, however, of those who intrude on the palaces of crystallized light and captured flame in which they dwell. They often chase even those who come bearing gifts away; few visitors have anything they desire, for what they desire most is to be left alone. The jyotis' full wrath is reserved for natives of the Shadow Plane and the Negative Energy Plane. Historically, the promise of battle with the gargoyle-like sceaduinars, whom they consider it their duty to oppose, has been the only thing to lure jyoti armies beyond the Positive Energy Plane.
Jyoti make ideal guardians for artifacts too dangerous to be left where those hungry for power might seize them. Only they know what items of myth and legend, long thought lost or destroyed, lie within their crystal vaults. They are unreliable guardians of religious artifacts, however, which usually disgust them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Kalavakus (Slaver Demon).
Kalavakuses work as slavers in the Abyss, earning them the alternate moniker of “slaver demons”; these fiends round up captured victims and sell them to other fiends or unscrupulous mortals. Pleas for freedom or clemency fall on deaf ears, as slaver demons consider anyone they can catch and hold to be their rightful property and theirs to sell. Kalavakuses know more than just physical means of restraining slaves; they also know how to fetter a victim’s soul. The most successful slaver demons have vast slave-pits in the Abyss where they keep stables of imprisoned souls.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications. For planar ally, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.
The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.
The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.
Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.
When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.
The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.
The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.
While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.
Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Keketar.
The ruling caste of the proteans, keketars orchestrate attacks against the bastions of law and adjudicate protean disputes confidently and capriciously. A keketar resembles a shimmering, serpentine creature with spines, claws, and a dragon-like head. A keketar’s actual appearance is in constant flux, but they generally stay about 18 feet long with a weight of around 1,500 pounds. While their physical forms can vary, two things remain constant: First, a keketar’s eyes are always a piercing shade of amber or violet. Second, the keketar’s mark of office—a crown of shifting symbols that hovers above its head—never changes. A keketar cannot remove its crown but can suppress it, although most are loath to do so and consider such an act one of cowardice or shame.
Keketars fill a role in protean society of a sort of priesthood, operating as intermediaries between the other proteans and the Speakers of the Depths. All other proteans defer to keketars, treating them in a way similar to how citizens of a mortal city would treat respected nobles; even more powerful proteans defer to the will of the keketars. As with many religions, dogma and theology are prone to interpretation and change, and among the proteans the situation is perhaps even more pronounced. Whatever the nature of and desires held by the mysterious Speakers of the Depths, individual keketars may come to dramatically different conclusions as to their will and intent. To the proteans, though, this inherent dissonance is a strength rather than a weakness.
Proteans divide themselves into a loose caste system and possess a dizzying variety of powers. Most proteans have a serpentine body with the head of a primeval beast. Scholars have long been intrigued by this fact—that scions of dissolution and disorder would share so many features—pointing out that even in the purest chaos there is some semblance of order. Others note that the serpentine form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion and lack of consensus surrounding their kind. After all, if even chaos cannot be trusted to be chaotic, would that not be the purest form of entropy?
Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves. When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature. D8Warpwave Effect 1Clumsy 2 (3 on a critical failure) 2Confused and gains 4d6 temporary Hit Points 3Dazzled (permanent on a critical failure) 4Enfeebled 2 (3 on a critical failure) 5Immobilized by filaments of energy 6Quickened (Stride, Strike, or Step only) 7Slowed 1 8Stupefied 2 (3 on a critical failure)
Among the numerous types of immortals that dwell in the Great Beyond, the proteans are surely some of the oldest. They’ve waged war against the inevitable aeons from the advent of their first creation, and speak longingly of that time before the gods themselves imposed order upon reality.
The Maelstrom, home of all proteans, is the whirling mass of turbulent primal energy, planar waves, and soul-stuff that surrounds the Outer Planes. Planar scholars theorize that all of reality was originally formed from the Maelstrom in the early days of the cosmos—a theory proteans don’t necessarily dispute.
Where proteans go, chaos follows. To proteans, there is no purer form of existence than entropy, and they constantly seek to oppose the establishment of order in the Great Beyond. However, proteans don’t see life as being incompatible with chaos; rather, they simply believe beings—immortal or not—deserve complete freedom on their own terms.
Many other proteans beyond those presented here dwell in the Maelstrom, including the spectral pelagastrs, the nearly humanoid shapechanging ourdivars, and the incredibly powerful izfiitars.
The most powerful of all proteans are a group of demigods known collectively as protean lords. Yet even their vast might pales in comparison to that of the mysterious Speakers of the Depths. The Speakers are the most enigmatic of the Maelstrom’s gods—even their exact nature is unknown, and scholars disagree as to whether they are even divinities or just aspects of the Maelstrom itself.
Individual proteans have two names: a traditional name in their hissing, confusing language; and an honorary title. The latter is easily translated to other languages, but a protean’s traditional name can only rarely be uttered in any tongue other than Protean. As such, most proteans tend to go by their titles when dealing with outsiders, referring to themselves as, for example, “Song of Gentle Poison” or “Sibilant Cry of the Storm.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Kelpie.
Kelpies are malevolent amphibious fey shapechangers intent on luring mortals to their doom. These cruel predators lurk in and around areas of water, slightly preferring freshwater over saltwater. Kelpies lure or drag their prey underwater then drown and devour them, leaving behind only the victim's heart and liver— the only parts of a meal kelpies find unpleasant. Kelpies are fond of magically disguising itself as fine steeds or attractive strangers to draw in victims, but its true appearance takes the form of a hideous equine with slimy, green flesh resembling aquatic plants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Kishi.
Kishi are duplicitous and murderous fey who dwell on the edges of Golarion’s darkest jungles. At first glance, kishi appear to be attractive humans, usually of a local ethnicity, but their full heads of thick hair conceal a second face, that of a snarling hyena. When a kishi lures their prey into a vulnerable situation, their head swivels around, revealing this fearsome visage. In this form, a kishi’s powerful jaws are almost impossible to pry loose and can crush a victim’s bones in a matter of moments. Kishi are highly varied in their physical features, and their height and weight are as variable as the people whose communities they infiltrate.
Like most fey, a kishi’s motives are inscrutable, though to its victims, the kishi’s goal seems simple—to revel in the expression of shock, betrayal, and terror on a victim’s face. Although kishi can cast charm to make unwitting companions complacent, most of these sinister creatures prefer to trick their prey using guile, gifts, and their dashing good looks. Kishi are the ultimate sociopaths, deriving pleasure from the thrill of the hunt as well as the delicious reward at the end. The more uptight, prudish, or haughty a target, the better, for nothing satisfies kishi as much as earning (and destroying) the trust of someone who rarely grants it.
When kishi get their new friends or lovers alone, they choose the most dramatic moments to reveal their true, monstrous forms and clamp their jaws down on their victim. Kishi have no desire to share their true nature with the entire village, so they typically aim for the throats of their victims, who, cut off from air, are unable to cry out for help. Kishi consume every part of their victims’ bodies, leaving no trace of the crime—even lapping up any spilled blood and cleaning the murder scene as much as they are able.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Kobold Dragon Mage.
Kobold dragon mages use magic to carry out their secret schemes. The presence of a dragon mage in a kobold warren is one of the greatest testaments to the kobolds’ claim to draconic heritage.
Kobolds are diligent and hardworking creatures, though they often turn these virtues toward selfish ends. While some kobolds live in communal collectives that maintain neutral relations with the creatures around them, they can be easily swayed into serving malevolent powers or megalomaniac leaders. This is in part due to kobolds’ innate pragmatism, as they would rather concede to servitude than risk being killed, but it is also in part due to a reverence for the power that kobolds generally lack. Dragons in particular are viewed with a deferential awe, and kobolds eagerly offer their services to such mighty and glorious creatures when they can. While kobolds may scheme against other leaders, especially those that control them via subjugation, dragons are usually viewed with adoration, no matter how brutal they might be to their kobold minions.
Kobolds consider themselves scions of dragonkind, and they are extremely proud of this purported heritage, no matter how laughable other creatures might consider these claims. Despite such skepticism, kobolds share more than a superficial resemblance to true dragons, with scale colorations closely matching the colors seen among chromatic dragonkind. Some kobolds develop a strong propensity toward powerful draconic magic and manifest these chromatic traits with more intensity. These so-called dragon mages are highly respected by other kobolds, and often rise to leadership positions within the tribe.
Certain kobold tribes eschew any concept of draconic lineage entirely and instead place their faith in the archdevils of Hell. These diabolist kobolds view those of their kind who simper at the feet of dragons as pathetic wretches. That they perform the same fearful worship to their chosen devil does not strike these infernally minded kobolds as an irony at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Kobold Scout.
Most kobolds encountered outside of a well-defended warren or lair are kobold scouts, creatures trained for stalking and the hunt.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Kobold Warrior.
The typical kobold trains with agile weaponry, favoring the light pick for its use in crafting new tunnels to expand their domains through underground reaches. Kobolds are capable of landing sneaky strikes against unsuspecting foes but are just as quick to scamper off to safety when they don’t, as a group, outnumber their enemies at least two to one.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Kolyarut.
Kolyarut inevitables are enforcers of bargains and punishers of those who fail to uphold them. Their humanoid shape, ability to disguise themselves among a humanoid population, and diplomatic leanings make them the most approachable inevitables, and thus more likely to ally themselves with others. They are among the most talkative of all inevitables, naturally possessing a courtly grace and an encyclopedic knowledge of social customs, which they use to assist their efforts in gathering information on their targets or issuing challenges in a legal manner.
As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons’ war against imbalance—particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos.
Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the “Convergence.” At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons — but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How—or if—this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves.
Whether the aeons serve an actual divinity, a philosophical concept, or merely a “supreme oneness” is a topic hotly debated by planar scholars. The aeons themselves are silent, referring to this being or concept as the Monad, a “condition of all.” Regardless of what the Monad actually is, there certainly exists another category of powerful aeons—the primal inevitables, each a unique demigod with its own powers and goals. Relatively few primal inevitables remain today, for nearly three-quarters of their irreplaceable kind have fallen in the endless battle with the inexorable forces of entropy.
Aeons are among the least understood of the Great Beyond’s immortal creatures, and they have a wide range of powers and abilities. Far more aeons exist than those presented here, including guardians of time like the four-armed bythos and the weirdly symmetrical theletos, which moderates the duality between freedom and fate.
To mortals, aeons sometimes seem to combine elements that are fundamentally incompatible, whether it's an aeon combining opposing concepts, or axiomites and inevitables mixing the organic with the mathematical or mechanical. Aeons see no paradox in this, but rather claim it is an expression of the underlying unity of all things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Korred.
Korreds are reclusive fey in the form of small, hirsute individuals with long, animated manes of hair. While korreds have a natural affinity and admiration for stones and boulders, they prefer to dwell aboveground in areas of rocky forest or wooded hills rather than in caves. Korreds are a private people who don't take kindly to intruders, and they invariably work to drive off or kill any non-fey who stumble into their territory. Staunchly proud of their hair, korreds choose their minimal attire so as to allow their body hair to flow freely, often wearing only a belt with a pouch for throwing rocks and trimming shears—though this belt and pouch are rarely visible under their wild manes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Kraken.
A kraken is an enormous, squid-like leviathan with a cruel intelligence. It hunts ships, whales, and heroes alike. The hatred and envy krakens hold for their rivals, the alghollthus, has led many krakens to make their lairs in sunken cities, where they can sift through ancient lore for long-lost arcane secrets.
A kraken’s hoard includes the plunder of ships lost at sea and the wealth of sunken cities. Virtually anything could be found in a kraken lair, but they especially covet scrolls, spell books, and other tomes of ancient lore, as well as gemstones and rarefied raw materials found only in the ocean depths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Krooth.
Krooths, sometimes called crocodile eaters, are fast and vicious hunters of bogs and wetlands. While they are known to hunt and eat crocodiles, alligators, and virtually any creature with flesh, their favorite prey are lizardfolk, boggards, and dinosaurs.
Krooths are found alone or in packs. Male krooths are solitary and territorial creatures—fierce, bold, and bloodthirsty. Female krooths, on the other hand, are likely to shy away from potential predators but swiftly turn violent when their brood is threatened. Because their offspring are so vulnerable, female krooths gather in packs to raise their young, sending smaller groups to hunt for food while the rest of the pack watches the brood. Krooths mate only once every 4 or 5 years, and the mating process is a curiously gruesome spectacle. An entire pack of females will hunt as a group for a lone male krooth, claiming their prize in an orgiastic frenzy that can last for an entire day and night. After the mating has finished, the females slay their mate and devour his nutrient-rich flesh, and his organs in particular. These organs contain a unique chemical compound vital to gestation. Many naturalists will pay handsomely for the fresh remains of a male krooth so they can study the strange properties of the creature’s blood and organs. In addition, krooths have poisonous, hollow teeth. When these creatures bite their prey, a tooth breaks off and causes the victim to bleed profusely as their blood pours through the hollow tooth.
Whether male or female, krooths seem to be repelled by goblinoid flesh, especially that of bugbears. This doesn’t mean krooths won’t kill goblinoids, especially those threatening their young, but they typically do so using only their claws and tails, and they take great care to clean themselves thoroughly after such a killing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Lamia.
Just as they were cursed long ago, lamias can curse those they touch, clouding the mind and regressing conscious thought to purely animalistic instincts. Creatures affected by this curse grow reckless, becoming unaware of the consequences of their own actions and unable to think clearly. This makes the hapless victim all the more susceptible to the lamia’s cunning illusions and insidious charms. The lamia’s animalistic nature and the effect of their cursed touch has led some scholars to theorize that the original lamias must have, millennia ago, turned away from their own reason and intellect and embraced the life of simple beasts. Whether this change was rewarded as a monstrous gift from Lamashtu or inflicted as a curse for abandoning their responsibilities by Pharasma remains the subject of debate to this day.
Whatever the source of this ancient transformation, lamias themselves have grown to enjoy the strengths it has granted them. Regardless, they continue to cling to a hatred of the gods, seeing them as the cause of their monstrous forms and, thus, their eternal exile from the societies they watch with jealous eyes from their lairs amid the ruins of lost civilizations. Because lamias blame divine powers for their curse, they take special delight in the downfall of temples, the suffering and death of champions and clerics, and the spread of dissension within organized religions.
While they can brie y assume humanoid form with magic, lamias are usually forced to hide from civilization, making their homes in the barren wilderness. There, they attract cults of their own, gathering up chaotic and evil humanoids. With the help of these cultists, lamias strive to bring down popular faiths, introduce schisms into flourishing churches, and humiliate or defame high-profile religious leaders. Most lamias themselves have no true religious faith in anything, hearing instead a mystical calling that manifests as sighs on the desert wind or murmurs from the dark places between the stars.
Lamias are traditionally matriarchal, revering the eldest female among them as leader, mother, and shaman.
Lamias dwell on the edge of civilization in crumbling keeps, abandoned cities, and the fallen temples of forgotten gods.
Lamias salvage gold, jewels, and magic items from the abandoned temples and ruined cities where they make their lairs. They sometimes arm themselves with enchanted daggers.
Adventurers report encounters with other varieties of lamia, including immense versions with the upper torsos of giants, monstrosities driven by insatiable hunger, or flying buzzard-like beasts with hardly any humanoid features, yet all of these variants bow to the wisdom and influence of the lamia matriarchs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Lamia Matriarch.
The brilliant and powerful lamia matriarchs possess boundless ambition, always seeking to bring more people and territory into the clutches of their kind. Consequently, the become rulers of other lamia. For all their cruelty toward other creatures, they’re fierce protectors of other lamia, and consequently they quickly come to rule cults or warbands. Regardless of the lamia’s gender, these ascended lamias are always known as matriarchs. Rather than leonine limbs, a lamia matriarch’s lower body is formed in the winding coils of a giant snake. They’re also set apart by the occult power they pursue, and some have even have grand designs to break the animalistic curse that transformed them. However, every attempt so far has led to the matriarch’s fall.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Lantern Archon.
Friendly, curious, and eternally optimistic, lantern archons embody the virtue of hope. They are formed of living light given corporeal shape, and they serve as beacons, guiding mortals out of their darkest moments and toward the path of righteousness. Their luminous bodies can icker with the subtlety of a candle flame or flare up like a torch. Lantern archons can control all aspects of their light as easily as other creatures control their facial expressions, leading them to change color, twinkle, and otherwise dim and brighten in time with their actions and words. While effervescent and chipper in conversation, lantern archons are impressively stoic mobile support troops and guardians in times of con ict, and are capable of uniting to form powerful warriors of light called gestalts.
Archons live in the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven. They manifest in the Garden at the mountain’s peak from mortal souls who answer a mysterious voice. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms. Intensely orderly in their metamorphosis, new archons begin as lantern archons or other lesser forms, transforming into ever-greater archons as their virtue and achievements grow. Each archon represents a particular virtue, such as hope, charity, justice, or courage, and they gain strength in the presence of mortals who exemplify this virtue. Due to their extremely lawful nature, archons sometimes find themselves at odds with azatas.
While archons do not seek to gather or maintain wealth, they do appreciate beauty and art, and their domains are often decorated with valuable crafts and creative works. Their armor and weapons are similarly ornate, and they always clean and polish their gear after battle. Archons value order—and thus tidiness—in all things.
As with angels and azatas, the most powerful of archons are a caste of demigods known collectively as empyreal lords. Each archon empyreal lord is a unique and powerful creature that keeps a domain somewhere in Heaven and is worshipped on Material Plane worlds. Archon divinities serve a variety of goals and focus on different aspects of righteousness. Some, such as Zohls, hold influence over the pursuit of truth and determined investigations, while others, like Damerrich, the demigod of executions, emphasize the punishment of unrepentant wrongdoers and seek to obliterate evil in all its forms.
When a spirit becomes an archon, they usually start as a lantern archon, the lowliest of archonkind. As they perform noble deeds and bolster their pureness of heart, an archon evolves into greater forms, possibly skipping stages or remaining in others for long spans of time, depending on their particular strengths and personality.
While commonly found in Heaven, archons can also be encountered on the fiendish planes in their endless crusade against evil. On the Material Plane they are usually encountered as advisors or saviors to those in need.
Always ready to defend others, most archons are never encountered out of their suits of armor. Even those who eschew armor, such as the bastion archon, tend to still appear as if they are wearing heavy protection against the scourge of battle.
Archons reside in Heaven, a plane that appears as a single massive mountain. Heaven is broken into seven tiers, with most archons occupying the second level and base of army operations, Proelera, or the sixth level, Iudica, the administrative heart of Heaven.
Many other archons than those presented here patrol Heaven or crusade in the fiendish planes, including the resolute hound archon soldiers and sentinels, and the supreme bastion archons, who rank among Heaven’s most powerful defenders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Leaf Leshy.
Leaf leshys are diminutive protectors of forests clad in pine cone armor and hats of fruit, flowers, or leaves. They enjoy mock battles but act cautiously in real ones.
Because of their relative frailty, leaf leshys frequently act as liaisons and call upon more powerful forest guardians when their domains are threatened. Nymphs, sprites, and other goodly fey may respond to the call of a leaf leshy, as do arboreals and other plant creatures.
When a leshy dies, its body explodes in a wave of vegetation as its spirit returns to the natural world. Though leshy spirits that are called into new bodies after death typically keep only vague recollections of their pasts, they retain many of the values and habits of their former life.
Leshys are fairly egalitarian when interacting with their own kind. Most communities are meritocracies, rewarding leshys who defend their communities and help each other succeed, and they see working together as the best path to a successful future.
Occasionally, a leshy proves so valuable to their community that they're uplifted as a hero. These admired leshys are not all warriors; outstanding artisans, caretakers, or diplomats might also be lauded as heroes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Legion Archon.
Despite their flaming blades and heavy armor, legion archons are the diplomats of peace among the archons, preferring justice via compromise and mutual benefit rather than justice by the sword. Nonetheless, when forced to fight against fiendish powers—especially fiends that embody the sin of wrath—legion archons don’t hesitate in battle, mounting offensives under divine commanders like Iomedae.
Archons live in the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven. They manifest in the Garden at the mountain’s peak from mortal souls who answer a mysterious voice. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms. Intensely orderly in their metamorphosis, new archons begin as lantern archons or other lesser forms, transforming into ever-greater archons as their virtue and achievements grow. Each archon represents a particular virtue, such as hope, charity, justice, or courage, and they gain strength in the presence of mortals who exemplify this virtue. Due to their extremely lawful nature, archons sometimes find themselves at odds with azatas.
While archons do not seek to gather or maintain wealth, they do appreciate beauty and art, and their domains are often decorated with valuable crafts and creative works. Their armor and weapons are similarly ornate, and they always clean and polish their gear after battle. Archons value order—and thus tidiness—in all things.
As with angels and azatas, the most powerful of archons are a caste of demigods known collectively as empyreal lords. Each archon empyreal lord is a unique and powerful creature that keeps a domain somewhere in Heaven and is worshipped on Material Plane worlds. Archon divinities serve a variety of goals and focus on different aspects of righteousness. Some, such as Zohls, hold influence over the pursuit of truth and determined investigations, while others, like Damerrich, the demigod of executions, emphasize the punishment of unrepentant wrongdoers and seek to obliterate evil in all its forms.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Lemure.
These shapeless masses of quivering flesh are the least of devilkind. Pathetic creatures from Hell’s first layer, lemures roam alongside damned and suffering souls. Pit fiends can combine the essence of a mob of lemures to concentrate their collective wickedness with a single form, granting it an infernal sentience and transforming it into a more powerful devil (see the pit fiend’s Devil Shaping ability).
At any one time, eight archdevils rule the eight upper layers of Hell, while the deepest layer is ruled by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a unique demigod with a dedicated role in guiding the infernal machine forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city. Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries, and Belial designs new weapons for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the oldest archdevil and keeper of many secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs armies. Baalzebul is a brooding archdevil who has fallen from Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty Mephistopheles was formed from the plane of Hell itself.
Many unique and powerful devils hold positions of power in Hell. The most numerous of these are the infernal dukes, many of whom were promoted to this position from already impressive statures as pit fiends. The supreme ruler of Hell itself is Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness. Between these two tiers rule the eight archdevils—see the sidebar on the facing page.
The nine layers of Hell are the planar home of all devils, and they much prefer its tyrannically ordered environs to anywhere else in the multiverse. Yet devils can be encountered anywhere mortals can be tempted by infernal bargains or seek diabolic aid. On Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is particularly aligned with Hell. Its government is based upon Hellʼs organization, and the state church is that of Asmodeus.
Devils view daemonsʼ constant hunt for souls as a short-sighted waste of potential, and demonsʼ chaotic destruction of society and flesh as uncivilized and obnoxious, but they do not loathe their fiendish counterparts. Indeed, most devils are more than willing to take advantage of daemons and demons as they can to further their own machinations.
Stinking, sulfurous hellfire is infused with evil. Hellfire always deals a combination of fire damage and evil damage, though the specific ratio depends on the hellfire's origin. Certain types of hellfire can impose other effects on creatures as well, such as sapping their strength or memories.
While travel to and from Hell is possible with plane shift, another way to reach and traverse the infernal realms is via hellmouths, strange living portals connecting different layers or even different planes. A hellmouth takes the form of a grimacing face, distended maw, or other distressingly organic aperture, and no two share the same appearance. Most are carefully guarded, but some new or well-hidden hellmouths have yet to be discovered.
The devils presented on these pages are a small sampling of the torments Hell has to offer. Other devils, like the inquisition-focused bone devils, the cherub-faced and fly-bodied accuser devils, and the aquatic drowning devil are a few examples of these widespread immortal creatures.
The four queens of the night wield great power in the Pit. Ardad Lili is a plotter and manipulator with ambitions of ruling the heavens, while Doloras revels in suffering. Most distant is Mahathallah, watching over fate and death. Mightiest among them is Eiseth, who is assembling an army in Dis in the hopes of claiming the iron throne of Malebolge.
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little use for compassion or empathy. As such, it exists entirely within a strict hierarchy, and this order extends to its denizens. While different types of demons correspond to various sins and daemons are associated with modes of mortal death, the different types of devils exist solely to fulfill particular roles in the infernal machine. On occasion, a particular devil can transcend the role for which they were literally shaped, but this often transforms the devil physically into the type suitable for their new role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Leng Spider.
The monstrous, bloated spiders from the windswept realm of Leng build eerie, dangerous lairs with the aid of magically compelled slaves. Leng spiders have anywhere from five to 13 legs, but never an even number.
Leng spiders build complex lairs out of their webs, many of which serve a dual purpose as temples to the eldritch gods they venerate. Most Leng spiders worship deities of the Elder Mythos, such as Hastur, Nyarlathotep, or Yog-Sothoth, among others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Leopard.
Leopards are among the smallest of the big cats, yet they are still dangerous creatures to tangle with. Leopard statistics can also be used for black panthers, white-spotted snow leopards, or tawny-coated cougars.
Leopards are exceptionally adaptable, able to survive in any grassland, forest, or jungle, and even the fringes of deserts.
Lions live in grassy plains and savannas, although species adapted for temperate environs that dwell in mountains exist as well. Male mountain lions lack the mane of their somewhat larger grassland-dwelling kin, but are no less dangerous.
While tigers are most common in forests, they also inhabit grasslands and savannas as long as vegetation is dense, and their dens are often found in caves.
Smilodons live in wooded and grassland areas.
While it's common practice to keep a house cat in the home to ward off unwanted rodents, keeping a big cat for a pet is a different matter entirely. Nevertheless, up-and-coming merchant lords, impetuous princes and princesses, and status-obsessed nobles have tried to do just that, often resulting only in terrified house staff and ruined upholstery. Many among the idle rich will gladly pay for the services of an unscrupulous druid or ranger who promises to help them achieve their dreams of an oversized feline friend, but the dire risks of such an endeavor are enough to dissuade even the greediest would-be animal trainers from even attempting the feat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Leprechaun.
Leprechauns are mostly jovial tricksters who prefer mischief over conflict. They fill their days with as much fun, wine, and food as possible. Mostly found in forested regions, leprechauns respect nature and those who protect it.
Leprechauns do not attack on sight. Rather, they engage in conversation and try to charm, cajole, or trick those they meet into doing favors for them or freely giving over a treasured item, usually in return for illusory wealth or false promises of wealth and success. These small tricksters are masters at discerning the desires of those they meet—a knack that puts them in a powerful position when bargaining for goods or favors. They aren't above turning people against each other for their own benefit but generally not to an extent that causes harm.
In most cases, a leprechaun doesn't keep a purloined possession for long. The leprechaun most often returns such stolen prizes just in time to defuse tensions, often as they point out the humor of the situation, hoping to share their amusement and mirth with the victim. In cases where a leprechaun's trick goes too far and results in an incensed victim, the leprechaun quickly flees the conflict rather than engage in combat. This willingness to return stolen goods or to flee from battles fades as leprechauns grow older. Ancient leprechauns who have lived for thousands of years often spiral into dark bitterness and increasingly use their powers and illusions to lure those who offend them or fail to appreciate a joke into danger... or even death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Lerritan.
Lerritans are unstoppable giants with skin of volcanic glass and blood of roiling lava. These malicious arsonists would see the world burned to a cinder. They pay homage to Ymeri, the evil elemental demigod of fire, and they bully other fiery creatures. When the urge to immolate grows too great to ignore, lerritans burn forests, destroy villages, and boil rivers, but they avoid large bodies of water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Lesser Death.
No one is quite sure what lesser deaths are, though some claim that they are avatars of the grim reaper. Unlike that strange hunter, however, lesser deaths hunt in packs on rare occasions. More often than not, they manifest from cursed magic items. Other times, they are just the enactors of death, hunting in the same way the grim reaper does— silently, with neither remorse nor quarter. Rarely, multiple lesser deaths work together to cull a large population, their scythes cutting through crowds and leaving entire cities devoid of life, inspiring (hopefully) false rumors of multiple grim reapers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Leucrotta.
The vile and vicious offspring of a demon lord and a monstrous species of hyenas, leucrottas are intelligent and cruel beasts. They use their astounding vocal mimicry to lure unsuspecting creatures near so that they can first torment and then devour them. Leucrottas measure 5 feet at the shoulder and weigh 800 pounds, and they are perpetually filthy. A leucrotta's oversized jaws are lined with rows of jagged, hardened bony ridges rather than teeth, and it can shear through flesh, bone, and even steel with ease.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Leukodaemon (Pestilence Daemon).
These skull-headed, vulture-winged daemons are harbingers of pestilence and servants of their patron Horseman, Apollyon. Manifestations of evil souls who perished from disease in life, leukodaemons work tirelessly to spread disease across all the worlds of the multiverse. More than any other daemon, leukodaemons cooperate with each other and those who conjure them to mortal worlds to spread sickness and plague, eschewing personal glory for end results.
While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals’ fear.
While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane of pure evil for only the most corrupt souls. If Hell is a realm of torture and systematic depravity, Abaddon is its twisted cousin—a place where one can find only misery and despair in ample quantities, with neither the strictures of Hell nor the chaotic freedom of the Abyss. For evildoers who seek simply to inflict their wickedness on others, Abaddon is a rich hunting ground where one can revel in turpitude, though visitors be forewarned: the competition is fierce.
The four Horsemen are the most powerful of the daemonic demigods, but they are only four of many. Far more daemonic harbingers dwell on Abaddon, each a unique and powerful demigod in their own right that enjoys sweeping influence among daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector (ruler of the slave city of Awaiting Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian (consort to the Horseman of Famine), and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame (patron to arsonists and agent of the Horseman of War) are but three of the dozens of harbingers who rule realms in Abaddon.
Each of the four Horsemen is served by a specific category of servitor daemons known as deacons. Leukodaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Pestilence. Meladaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Famine, while thanadaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Death. Purrodaemons are currently the most powerful of the deacons, and serve the Horseman of War—yet over time, which category of deacon is the most powerful can wax and wane.
Numerous powerful and unique daemon demigods, known collectively as harbingers, rule over swaths of Abaddon. Above these demigods, though, are entities of even greater power—the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. As the eons go on, the names and identities of specific horsemen change. Currently, they consist of Apollyon (Horseman of Pestilence), Charon (Horseman of Death), Szuriel (Horseman of War), and Trelmarixian (Horseman of Famine). Of these, only Charon has never fallen to an upstart. Some hold that a “Fifth Horseman” once ruled over the other four, while others maintain that the eternally eclipsed sun in the skies above Abaddon is all that remains of this long-dead god.
As many daemons exist as there are awful ways to die. The bloody sangudaemon personifies death by blood loss, while the skeletal thanadaemon represents death from old age. The most powerful daemons are the olethrodaemons, who represent the massive deaths caused by apocalypses and the end of entire worlds.
Daemons often carry soul gems either as trophies or for powering an ability. Cacodaemons are the most common source for soul gems, but they can also be created by spells like bind soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem to power an ability, the trapped soul is released into the afterlife and can be resurrected normally.
Soul gems are traded in illicit markets, a tradition celestials and psychopomps alike find vile. Soul gems' value varies, but is generally worth an amount relative to the level of a gem's captive soul.
Daemons embody a fundamental paradox—while they are incarnations of death and seek to devour all that lives, they are themselves living creatures. Some speak of a glorious end time after which reality will finally be free of the contagion that is life itself. Most daemons give no thought to this paradox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Leydroth.
In ancient times, a cabal of primalists imbued an amalgam of beasts with both supernatural might and a hatred of magic itself, hoping to achieve a potent weapon for use against arcane spellcasters. Effective beyond expectation, the first leydroths broke free and turned on their creators. Worse, the leydroths bred true, and these reclusive predators have long outlived their original creators.
Leydroths look like distorted, apelike felines with many-branching horns growing from the backs of their heads. Their thickly muscled limbs end in glowing claws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Lich.
A wizard whose insatiable desire for arcane power eclipsed their mortal life, the lich is a truly devious and versatile spellcaster.
After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich’s servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich’s lair is a good indicator of the undead’s current mental state.
For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.
A lich can be any type of spellcaster, as long as it has the ability to perform a ritual of undeath as the primary caster (which can usually be performed only by a spellcaster capable of casting 6th-level spells). To create a lich, follow these steps.
Increase the spellcaster's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
Increase spell DCs and spell attack roll by 2.
A lich gains the undead trait and becomes evil. Liches lose all abilities that come from being a living creature.
A lich gains the following abilities.
Darkvision
Saving Throws +1 status bonus to all saves vs. positive
Negative Healing
Rejuvenation (arcane, necromancy) When a lich is destroyed, its soul immediately transfers to its phylactery. A lich can be permanently destroyed only if its phylactery is found and destroyed.
Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious
Resistances cold 20, physical 15 (except magic bludgeoning)
Frightful Presence (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 60 feet, DC 30
Hand of the Lich All liches have a hand unarmed attack that deals 1d8 negative damage for every 3 levels and inflicts a paralyzing touch. This attack has the finesse trait.
Drain Phylactery Frequency once per day; Effect The lich taps into its phylactery's power to cast any arcane spell up to the highest level the lich can cast, even if the spell being cast is not one of the lich's prepared spells. The lich's phylactery doesn't need to be present for the lich to use this ability.
Paralyzing Touch (arcane, curse, incapacitation, necromancy) A creature damaged by the lich's hand Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save against the lich's spell DC – 4. The creature becomes paralyzed for 1 round on a failure. On a critical failure, the creature is paralyzed permanently, falls prone, and seems dead. A DC 25 Medicine check reveals the victim is alive.
Although the abilities above are standard for a lich, you can create a more unusual lich by substituting any one of the following abilities for frightful presence, hand of the lich, Drain Phylactery, or paralyzing touch.
Blasphemous Utterances (arcane, aura, enchantment, mental) 10 feet. The lich is accompanied by a constant echo of blasphemous murmurs and tainted whispers. A creature in the aura takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against mental effects and can't take actions that have the concentrate trait unless they succeed at a DC 10 flat check. Failing this check wastes the action.
Cold Beyond Cold The lich's hand Strike deals cold damage instead of negative, and instead of being paralyzed, the target is slowed 2. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to slowed 1 (or negates it on a critical success).
Dark Deliverance The lich has resistance to positive equal to its level.
Siphon Life Trigger The lich deals damage with its hand Strike. Effect The lich regains Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt.
Void Shroud (aura, death, necromancy) 30 feet. The lich is surrounded by an aura of death, drawing forth souls to be consumed by the lich's constant hunger. Living creatures in the emanation take a –2 status penalty to saves against fear and death effects. In addition, any creature that starts its turn in the area gains the doomed 1 condition unless it succeeds at a Will save against the lich's spell DC – 4. Associated MonstersUndead minions are very common companions for a lich or demilich. Liches prefer mindless undead, that do what they’re told and don’t interrupt the lich’s studies with useless conversation. Liches with a knack for crafting are also fond of surrounding themselves with construct servitors and guardians, such as golems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Lillend (Muse Azata).
Lillends are tale-tellers, chroniclers, and champions of freedom of expression. They are generally peaceful, but are quick to act if a masterful piece of art is threatened or free speech is suppressed. They pride themselves on inspiring mortals to greater heights of expression and creativity, and more than one bard looks to a lillend as their personal inspiration. Lillends sometimes secretly follow the adventures of mortal heroes to record their stories as epic poems and songs, which they then perform in the packed mead halls of Elysium. When pursuing such goals, lillends take pains to use their innate spells to remain in hiding, as they would rather observe and record events without “polluting” them with their own intervention. Nevertheless, a lillend who sees their charge faced with certain death often cannot resist the urge to intervene and save the day. Inevitably, this brings a close to the lillend’s chronicles, as their relationship with their subject invariably shifts from one of detached observation to friendship or more. Yet lillends remain hesitant to involve themselves for overlong in a mortal’s life, in part because they fear what sort of fiendish attention their presence might attract, but mostly out of respect for the mortal’s own destiny. A lillend would, all things being equal, prefer to let mortals choose their own fate rather than run the risk of sending someone down a path to which their heart is not set.
The most powerful of all azatas belong to the cast of demigods known as empyreal lords. These lesser deities maintain many cults across many Material Plane worlds, and count among their kind such diverse demigods as Ashava, a protector of lost spirits and dancer in the moonlight; Black Butterfly, a mysterious agent of Desna and patron of the depths of outer space; and Sinashakti, joyful wanderer and deliverer of wisdom to vagabonds.
While azatas would like to think they are above material wealth, the truth is that most azatas adore finery and displays of beauty or grandeur. They might explain away bejeweled weapons as necessary tools against the forces of evil, or the wild array of jewelry and silks they wear as important diplomatic tools.
The wilds of Elysium play host to a wide array of azatas, the most varied and widespread of the celestials. From the four-eyed mothlike uinuja to the supernaturally verdant and beautiful veranallia, whose lower body is a wondrous garden of wildflowers and plant life, azatas are nothing if not diverse!
While the idyllic realm of Elysium is the home plane of azatas, their overwhelming curiosity and natural wanderlust often lead them to travel far from this plane. On other planes, they can be seeking to right wrongs, looking for entertainment, or merely exploring to see the sights. More than a few azatas, taken by a whimsical urge to spread their sometimes unwelcome jocosity, see it as their duty to tease uptight or humorless mortal creatures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Lion.
Lions are cooperative hunters, ambushing dangerous prey in groups of lionesses that work in tandem to trap and kill their prey. Male lions are typically larger, with long manes, and when they hunt, they tend to do so on their own.
Leopards are exceptionally adaptable, able to survive in any grassland, forest, or jungle, and even the fringes of deserts.
Lions live in grassy plains and savannas, although species adapted for temperate environs that dwell in mountains exist as well. Male mountain lions lack the mane of their somewhat larger grassland-dwelling kin, but are no less dangerous.
While tigers are most common in forests, they also inhabit grasslands and savannas as long as vegetation is dense, and their dens are often found in caves.
Smilodons live in wooded and grassland areas.

Many among the idle rich will gladly pay for the services of an unscrupulous druid or ranger who promises to help them achieve their dreams of an oversized feline friend, but the dire risks of such an endeavor are enough to dissuade even the greediest would-be animal trainers from even attempting the feat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Lion Visitant.
Scars and other marks of obvious mistreatment are the clearest indicators that an undead animal is no mere zombie.
These undead monsters haunt the sites of their demise and search out the masters who made their lives so hellish with only one goal in mind: vengeance. When they can’t locate their particular abuser, or if they are still unable to rest even after confronting their aggressor, visitants seek out similarly evil harmers of animals, becoming torturers of torturers. However, visitants are for the most part unable to distinguish between individual members of a species; thus, if a visitant was abused by a human trainer, any human that crosses its path may become a target of its rage.
A visitant resembles a zombified animal, but it retains a spark of the animal intelligence it had in life, making it all the more dangerous as a result. Visitants’ bodies are marred by the horrors of their brutal existences: Their mouths are furrowed in a constant snarl, with a black ichor dripping from their cracked, rotten lips. Whip scars from their hours of “training” glow with an unnatural purple light. And perhaps above all, their eyes mark them as touched by undeath—sunken horribly deep into their skull, leaking blood or other fluid, and glowing with an aura of dread and palpable anger.
You can modify visitants by applying the following abilities. Most visitants have one of these abilities, but more powerful visitants might have more, in which you might consider increasing the visitant’s level and statistics.
Noxious Breath The visitant exhales sharply, releasing pungent fumes from its lungs in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (sickened 2 on a critical failure).
Roar (auditory, concentrate, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental, primal) The visitant lets out a loud and horrifying roar. Each creature within 100 feet must attempt at a Will save. No matter the result, affected creatures are then temporarily immune to the effect for 1 minute.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is frightened 1.
Failure The creature is frightened 2.
Critical Failure The creature is frightened 3.
Vengeful Presence (aura, emotion, enchantment, mental) 20 feet. A creature that starts its turn within the visitant’s aura must succeed at a Will save or be overcome with a thirst for vengeance. For 1d4 rounds (1 minute on a critical failure), if the affected creature was attacked within the last round (whether or not the attack hit), the creature must use at least 1 action per round to Strike or use a hostile action toward its last attacker as long as the attacker is still alive. Failure to do so deals the affected creature 1d6 mental damage, plus 1d6 for every 5 levels the visitant has.
Wrestle The visitant makes a claw Strike against a creature it has grabbed. If the attack hits, that creature is knocked prone.
To create a visitant animal, use one of the stat blocks on this page as a starting point. Adjust the size as necessary and give its Strikes reach if it’s Huge or larger. Visitants can also be made using a zombie stat block as a base; in this case, adjust the creature’s Intelligence to –4. All visitants have imprecise lifesense as an additional sense.
Some visitants can cast the following innate occult spells. If you give a visitant the following spells, consider removing one of its other special abilities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Living Boulder.
Living boulders roll and glide through the Plane of Earth, gathering gemstones and metal shards until their surfaces resemble a ship's hull covered in barnacles. Barely more intelligent than many animals, living boulders fill much the same role on the Plane of Earth as the great herd animals found on Material Plane worlds.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Earth elementals sometimes have valuable gemstones or minerals incorporated into their bodies, and once they are slain, these valuables can be scavenged as treasure. Gemstones, precious metals such as silver or gold ore, or rarer materials such as mithral or adamantine can be harvested from these creatures, although the more expensive finds tend to be incorporated into only the most powerful earth elementals.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Living Graffiti.
A living graffiti is a painting or drawing that has come to life by way of strange magic. It typically looks like a cartoonish humanoid made of wet oil paint. These two-dimensional beings are unbound from the canvases on which they were originally drawn and can move along any flat surface they touch, including walls, floors, furniture, doors, and even bodies of still water. They cannot exist apart from the surfaces they traverse except in brief bursts, which they typically use to harass or attack nearby creatures. Although they are not incredibly intelligent, living graffiti exhibit a mischievous spitefulness and seeming desire to make the real world as much of a caricature as their own two-dimensional domain. Variant Living Graffiti The living graffiti below is but one type of this strange creature. Other living graffiti exist, made from media like chalk, pastels, ink, or tempera, or even more archaic materials like mud, beeswax, or blood. The following are a few examples of the kinds of abilities such a variant living graffiti might have.
Blood: The living graffiti gains the following ability.
Absorb Blood Anytime a creature within 5 feet of the living graffiti takes slashing, piercing, or persistent bleed damage, the graffiti gains a number of temporary HP equal to half the damage dealt to the adjacent creature.
Chalk: The living graffiti gains the following ability.
Cone of Chalk The living graffiti expels a 15-foot cone of chalk. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or be blinded for 1 round. The living graffiti can’t use Cone of Chalk again for 1d4 rounds.
Ink: The living graffiti’s HP increases to 60 and its splatter Strike deals 2d6 damage (in addition to blinding for 1 round), but it gains the following weakness.
Water Weakness When the living graffiti is doused with water or starts its turn in water (either through a spell or some other effect, such as pouring a bucket of water over it), it takes 2d6 damage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Living Landslide.
Living landslides resemble humanoids made of earth and gravel.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Living Sap.
The tall sharinga trees of the Mwangi Expanse leak golden sap from their swollen, bulbous trunks, which coagulates when exposed to air. The toxic resin, which has a bitter taste, protects the tree from herbivorous insects and other animals, but in rare cases—usually in areas awash in positive energy or the influence of the First World—the sap gains a life of its own. Such “living sap” is a mindless ooze that attempts to smother and engulf just about anything that moves, from the bugs and small beasts that feed on its sharinga tree to larger creatures unlucky enough to stumble upon it. Due to its immunities to most forms of physical damage and its protectiveness of its mother tree, a living ooze is a nuisance to communities that rely on the sap of sharinga trees to make resin, rubber, and glue.
Jungle-dwelling alchemists such as gripplis cherish the sap of the sharinga tree for its unique adhesive properties. The sap has been used for centuries to create tanglefoot bags, glue, and hard resin. Residue collected from a living sap is even more fascinating from an alchemical standpoint. Though harvesting a living sap is very dangerous, some alchemists will risk death (if not their own, then that of hearty adventurers for hire) in order to procure these easily worked ingredients. To increase the odds of a successful harvest, such employers are often willing to supply offensive aids such as lesser frost vials; living sap hunters learned long ago that cold energy is effective against these creatures and luckily doesn’t harm the harvestable reagents.<|endoftext|>

Often, nothing remains after defeating a fire elemental but a pile of ashes and the fading smell of smoke. But sometimes, fragments of their elemental power remain behind.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Lizardfolk Defender.
The lizardfolk defender serves as a protector of the young, guardian of the settlement, and when no other options are available, soldier in time of war. They eagerly rise to the defense of their kin but do not revel in battle. An iruxi defender would rather turn back intruders and allow them to flee with the knowledge they were beaten, in hopes that such word prevents further invasions, but they are not naive. The iruxi understand the need for revenge, and when they allow a foe to escape, they do not forget.
The word “lizardfolk” is an excellent example of humanity’s narrow-sighted view of this culture. The name of their people is “iruxi,” but these reptilian humanoids have patiently and good-naturedly accepted the name “lizardfolk” as a variant, and they generally resist urges to call humans and other mammalians similarly derivative names in return. Iruxis dwell and thrive in all tropical and temperate biomes, but they are most at home in swamplands, coastal regions, and riverlands, for they are talented swimmers, and fish and aquatic plants make up a large part of their preferred diets.
Though most are neutral in alignment, the typical iruxi’s pride in their traditions, suspicion of others, and need to protect their kin can make them seem standoffish or even aggressive when encountered. However, most are eager to learn from visitors, trade stories and equipment, and forge alliances.
Iruxis are, as a general rule, quite religious. Those who venerate deities typically look to Gozreh, but some of them find the teachings of Desna to be compelling. Most iruxis, though, instead follow druidic traditions, ancestor worship, and astrological philosophies in particular.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Lizardfolk Scout.
Iruxi scouts are the lizardfolk most often encountered by adventurers, for these explorers and hunters spend most of their lives on the move, constantly patrolling the territories held by their enclave. If intruders are driven off, it is the responsibility of the iruxi scouts to track them, observe them, and learn their ways and weaknesses so as to report back to the community and aid in the defense against potential reprisals.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Lizardfolk Stargazer.
The tradition of astrology and looking to the stars for both navigation and prognostication is well-established in iruxi society, and their wise and observant stargazers are among the people’s most respected members.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Luminous Ooze.
Luminous oozes are strange globular creatures that glow with brilliant multicolored light. Unlike many oozes, which rely on camouflage and stealth to attack their prey, luminous oozes attract victims with their impressive light displays before blinding them and launching into a frenzied attack. They are often found on the ceilings or walls of dark caverns, and more than a few curious spelunkers have met their end simply by investigating their strange yet beautiful light. The effects of electricity on luminous oozes are ill understood, though those who have studied these creatures liken their static-absorbing power to that of lightning rods.
These creatures are highly sought after by status-hungry socialites, flamboyant barkeeps, and daring showrunners, for in addition to being dangerous monsters, luminous oozes are also incredible sources of beautiful prismatic light, comparable to a magical light show but available for a fraction of the price. The trick, of course, is capturing and penning such a specimen. The most reliable means of caging a luminous ooze is with a permanent wall of force shaped into a cube or sphere, but few have the means to create or commission such an enclosure. Instead, most people who find themselves in possession of a luminous ooze simply put it in a thick glass box. As long as they are well fed, luminous oozes accept this treatment, though woe be unto anyone in the vicinity if a hungry luminous ooze should escape from its display case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Lunar Naga.
Lunar nagas are skilled diviners and astrologers whose dark scales and white hair sparkle with motes of light that mimic the night skies to which they are forever drawn. While they are less physically imposing than other nagas, they possess a graceful beauty that many find entrancing, even without the help of the naga's inherent magical abilities. Earning a lunar naga's trust is difficult, but not impossible, especially for someone who shares the creature's interest in the celestial sphere.
As they have no hands, lunar nagas use mage hand to manipulate delicate instruments and fine telescopes to observe the night sky. They track the positions of celestial bodies, recording their discoveries in esoteric journals. At their best, lunar nagas are wise and mysterious beings who seek to expand their knowledge of the cosmos. At their worst, after too much exposure to the unfathomable entities that dwell in the darkness between the stars, they become dark prophets who drive others to commit terrible deeds in the name of abominable masters.
On Golarion, the lunar nagas of the nation of Nagajor use their abilities to serve many communities as soothsayers. A few have founded observatories in which they and their followers explore the night sky. Some nagas even use their knowledge of the stars as navigators on ships or overland caravans. In the broader world, where people do not give nagas deference as nearly divine rulers, lunar nagas try to avoid contact with outsiders or use their magical powers of disguise to hide their true forms from all but their most worthy allies.
Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society—an entire empire ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers with a patriotic pride that borders on worship.
Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins. In many cases, these nagas have heard of distant Nagajor, but they are usually unwilling to abandon their own pursuits to seek out a land where they might be worshipped as gods.
Dark nagas might rule over goblins, orcs, xulgaths, or decadent folk, especially corrupt aristocrats. Guardian nagas might be found with other goodly creatures of any sort, from fey in natural sites to constructs in ancient vaults.
Beyond the sinister dark naga and the benevolent guardian naga, many other types of nagas exist, including the mesmerizing spirit naga, the multiheaded royal naga, and the introspective and mysterious lunar naga.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Lurker In Light.
These malicious and strange fey appear as fairies about 2 feet tall, with insectile wings, large eyes, and bulbous heads. They slaughter and cause mischief in a pattern only their alien intellect understands, but they've been seen to take particular umbrage against dwarves, gnomes, and creatures who live in darkness. With their grudges and pursuit of their own wicked and sadistic whims, lurkers in light deftly overturn the conventional wisdom that creatures associated with light are benign and friendly.
While lurkers in light are fey and have ties to the First World, these creatures are often found elsewhere in the Great Beyond. They are particularly fond of invading the Shadow Plane to bring light to those who dwell there-not to help, but to spread misery and pain among those to whom light is agonizing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Lyrakien (Wanderer Azata).
Lyrakiens are musical messengers and embodiments of free travel. They serve Desna and other deities and empyreal lords of Elysium, but are quite fond of the concept of free time and are always on the hunt for opportunities to pause in their duties to enjoy music or appreciate a moment of beauty. They love contests, stories, and songs, and they often challenge mortals to musical contests or pester them to share grand tales of their exploits. Lyrakiens rely on their agility to avoid conflicts, but they do their best to defend places of great natural beauty, especially against lawful or evil foes they can damage with their starlight. Lyrakiens have an innate wanderlust and rarely stay in the same place for very long. Some travel alongside adventurers, ofter writing songs about their quests and feats of derring-do.
Though light-hearted creatures, lyrakiens don't let their whimsical personalities get in the way of protecting breathtaking natural locations. Often called “glistenwings” by gnomes and halflings, they are frequently mistaken for sprites or similar fey, a bit of confusion that many lyrakiens find amusing and fertile ground for shenanigans involving those they deem deserving of a bit of unexpected fun and discord in their lives.
The most powerful of all azatas belong to the cast of demigods known as empyreal lords. These lesser deities maintain many cults across many Material Plane worlds, and count among their kind such diverse demigods as Ashava, a protector of lost spirits and dancer in the moonlight; Black Butterfly, a mysterious agent of Desna and patron of the depths of outer space; and Sinashakti, joyful wanderer and deliverer of wisdom to vagabonds.
While azatas would like to think they are above material wealth, the truth is that most azatas adore finery and displays of beauty or grandeur. They might explain away bejeweled weapons as necessary tools against the forces of evil, or the wild array of jewelry and silks they wear as important diplomatic tools.
The wilds of Elysium play host to a wide array of azatas, the most varied and widespread of the celestials. From the four-eyed mothlike uinuja to the supernaturally verdant and beautiful veranallia, whose lower body is a wondrous garden of wildflowers and plant life, azatas are nothing if not diverse!
While the idyllic realm of Elysium is the home plane of azatas, their overwhelming curiosity and natural wanderlust often lead them to travel far from this plane. On other planes, they can be seeking to right wrongs, looking for entertainment, or merely exploring to see the sights. More than a few azatas, taken by a whimsical urge to spread their sometimes unwelcome jocosity, see it as their duty to tease uptight or humorless mortal creatures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Magma Scorpion.
Whether skittering through Abyssal wastelands or basking in the searing sand of the deepest deserts, magma scorpions have charred carapaces constantly emitting vision-warping waves of heat.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
More than other elementals, fire elementals tend to deviate from neutrality, and are often good, evil, or chaotic in nature. Lawful fire elementals are rare. Fire's inherently capricious nature seems to prevent these creatures from succumbing to the influence of order.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Often, nothing remains after defeating a fire elemental but a pile of ashes and the fading smell of smoke. But sometimes, fragments of their elemental power remain behind. At the GM's discretion, a fire elemental can leave behind ashes, lumps of charcoal, or ever-smoldering cinders that are valuable components for the construction of fire-themed magic items.
Though fire and water classically oppose one another, in the right mixture they can become a dangerous combination. Water elementals heated to a scalding temperature through natural factors such as underwater volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent fire damage with their Strikes, while fire elementals infused with moisture might exude clouds of obscuring or even blinding steam.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Mammoth.
Found mostly in colder climates, mammoths are accustomed to dealing with desperate and dangerous predators, trampling and crushing their enemies while using their larger tusks to greater effect. Humanoids dwelling in harsh, frost-bound lands rely on the mammoth’s strength to help them survive.
Elephant tusks are a highly sought-after treasure, the ivory from a single tusk potentially fetching hundreds of gold coins. Those who value the elephant’s majestic presence are impassioned defenders of the creatures, making the hunt for ivory dangerous.
Elephants of all species are, by nature, social creatures who form strong bonds with one another, but when an elephant separates from its herd—either due to tragedy or an individual streak of viciousness—they become known as rogue elephants. These dangerous solitary creatures are ill-tempered and quick to attack anything that approaches them, and often have the elite adjustments to their statistics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Mandragora.
A mandragora looks like a freshly pulled tuber that has grown into the malformed shape of a child with a grotesque face and hideously bloated body. These insidious little plants typically form when a mandrake root is watered with a demon's blood. Upon absorbing the otherworldly properties of the demon's blood, the root animates and is forced to seek out blood to feast from, lest it die of thirst.
Always famished and in search for sustenance, mandragoras live haunted, pained lives and perform vile and desperate acts to acquire the blood they crave. While they prefer magically infused blood such as that of unicorns, fey, or sorcerers, and they can also feed off of potions, alchemical bombs, and other magical elixirs, a mandragora can subsist on the blood of non-magical creatures. They find the flavor of mundane blood to be bland and bitter, and they do not blanch at voicing these complaints to the creatures from which they drink.
While the typical mandragora is the size of a human child, some of these evil plants continue to grow and grow, reaching sizes more comparable to those of giants. Sometimes as they grow, they form additional limbs or rudimentary faces, eventually transforming into truly hideous mockeries of the human form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Manta Ray.
While manta rays might appear daunting, they are generally docile. Manta rays are found in temperate or tropical oceans, and they generally stay in the upper reaches or at the surface of deeper waters. These rays are filter feeders that subsist on plankton. They can also eat larger fish or aquatic creatures as the need arises, but rarely attack anything Small or larger. Many underwater cultures, particularly aquatic elves, raise and farm manta rays to serve as messengers, beasts of burden, or even pets. Manta rays don't make particularly good mounts, but some aquatic civilizations use them to draw underwater carriages.
Stingrays and manta rays are among the most common species of these fish, but others dwell in more remote areas. The dangerous blood ray is an ambush predator that dwells in murky swamp waters and drains creature's blood after paralyzing them with its sting, while the immense leviathan ray is a deep-ocean predator that has a deadly mouth capable of swallowing small ships whole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Manticore.
The manticore is a monstrous amalgamation of lion, dragon, and human with a penchant for feasting on human flesh. Its distinctive tail is festooned with large quills like those of a porcupine, which the manticore flings at prey by whipping its tail like a sling. These deadly spikes give the manticore the power to slaughter even well-armed warriors from the safety of the sky.
Although the anthropomorphic face of the manticore suggests a keen intellect, most creatures of its kind are simple-minded killers. They can be clever liars, however, and their voices have a strangely musical sound that has lured many unwitting travelers into an ambush. A manticore discovered by uneducated humanoids (especially those who are both lawful and evil) can sometimes become the center of adoration and even worship; a manticore in this situation swiftly gives in to its laziness and allows its acolytes to bring it tribute in the form of food and treasure, feasting upon its own followers when offerings become scarce. Stronger humanoids who encounter a manticore can cow it through intimidation and violence, sometimes even forcing it into service as a mount. As long as the manticore is well fed with human flesh and its master leads it to victory, a manticore mount can prove surprisingly loyal.
A manticore enjoys taking plunder from the corpses of its prey as trophies that flatter its vanity and testify to its strength. It has little interest in money, but sometimes accepts gold and jewels as tribute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Marid.
Marids are capricious but powerful genies from the Plane of Water; among geniekind, they are rivaled in power only by the fiery efreet. Marids embody the strength of the ocean’s waves and currents, but they also have a gentler side, loving performance and art such as dancing, music, and storytelling.
Marids regard efreet with hostility but rarely encounter them in their native environment. They get along with djinn, jann, and shaitans, although the latter consider marids flighty and annoying, associating only long enough to close trade deals. Marid society has strict rules of hospitality, and many marid cities have a magically sealed foreign quarter where marid shahzadas conduct business with air-breathers.
Genie nobles with titles unique to their kind (as detailed in each sidebar) rule genie society. Genie nobles are generally at least 5 levels higher than a typical example of their kind. In addition to the increased statistics afforded by their higher levels, genie nobles gain additional spells. But the most wondrous (and notorious) of a genie noble’s powers is their ability to grant wishes. Any genie noble (save for jann, who lack this power) can grant a mortal or undead creature up to three wishes within a year’s time. Many unscrupulous creatures compel genie nobles to serve them, tricking them or entrapping them with magic. However, once a genie noble grants a third wish to a single creature, they are freed from service to that creature forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Marilith (Pride Demon).
Mariliths are the generals of the Abyss, formed from the souls of proud evil mortals, often warlords and despots. They appear as tall and powerfully built humans from the waist up with snake tails and six arms. Because of Lamashtu’s prominence over other demonic deities, most pride demons encountered by mortals take female form, but they can be of any gender.
Mariliths are among the greatest tacticians in the Abyss, and they have an almost supernatural knack for understanding the ripples of chaos and the unpredictable nature of demonic life. Their ability to command armies rises as much from their commanding presence as it does their ability to read into the potential results of any possible act and a sufficient understanding of the flow of entropy to allow them to predict likely outcomes.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications. For planar ally, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.
The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.
The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.
Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.
When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.
The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.
The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.
While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.
Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Marrmora.
On the First World, marrmoras dwell in ruined wildlands perpetually scourged by fire and rarely, if ever, travel elsewhere. When a wildfire devastates a wilderness region on the Material Plane and results in the death of other fey, marrmoras can be drawn across the planar boundary to revel in the resulting destruction. They seek to reignite the fires that beckoned them, to gather up and feed upon the charred remains of those who perished within (particularly the bodies of dead fey), though they do grow homesick if they spend too much time away from the First World. They are burdened by a capricious but persistent rage and are unfailingly cruel. While they are capable of negotiation and intelligent interaction, they almost never bargain in good faith and typically interact with others only as a means to more efficiently spread their fiery devastation.
A marmorra's twisted appearance evokes the look of an arboreal whose bark has been burnt down to charcoal. They have nearly featureless faces and hands ending in long, sharp claws. Their broken flesh looks like charcoal-burnt wood, riddled with cracks that still glow with an unwholesome heat. They trail ash wherever they walk, and wisps of smoke curl off of their bodies. Though marrmoras enjoy the sight of any woodland and its inhabitants roasting in the flames of their carefully curated fires, there is little that brings more pleasure to a marrmora than the sight of good-aligned plant creatures cooking to a crisp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Marsh Giant.
Dwellers of brackish coastal salt marshes and fetid bogs and swamps, marsh giants are hideous in appearance indeed, with fishlike mouths, slimy gray-green skin, and dark, beady eyes. They prefer to eat the flesh of those they slay in battle, but many are also cannibals. It is perhaps this vicious behavior that keeps the creatures in check, for if a fellow marsh giant becomes too dangerous and powerful, it runs the risk of being ambushed and consumed by its clan.
Marsh giants are insular and mysterious, dedicating much of their lives to zealous worship of sea-dwelling deities or stranger entities. While there is no central religion followed by all marsh giants, many are known to venerate the demon lord Dagon, while others worship even more powerful monstrosities from the Elder Mythos, such as distant, dreaming Cthulhu.
Only rarely do more than a dozen marsh giants settle together in a location, but when they do it is often for a religious purpose. Whatever call from the deep draws them together also tugs at nearby creatures such as boggards or skum, who look upon marsh giants in fear and reverence. The grim, terrifying chants and screams coming from such an encampment are a sure sign of terror to come for any other residents of the area.
Barely topping 11 feet tall and 1,000 pounds, marsh giants are small for giants but make up for their relatively diminutive stature with their zealotry.
Giants often keep an eclectic collection of treasures in their knapsacks or bags. Among these can be found a staggeringly wide range of unexpected and odd treasures and valuables.
As oversized as they are, giants tend to dwell in remote regions of the world, where they have the luxury of claiming larger territories of their own.
As with many people, giants enjoy keeping pets. Yet for giants, what constitutes a pet is often categorized as beast to others. Large animals like bears and lions, and megafauna like woolly mammoths and dinosaurs are popular, as are more magical creatures like hell hounds, manticores, griffons, and the like.
Beyond the giants detailed here, many others dwell in remote regions of the world. Marsh giants are cultists who worship strange sea deities, shadow giants have ties to the Shadow Plane, and mountain giants are horrific butchers even other giants fear.
Giants are larger-than-life foes. While many giants have themes that tie them to elemental or magical forces, the primary theme giants share is that they embody a classic cultural trope as their basis. Fire giants, for example, can be seen as oversized smiths, while hill giants should evoke the flavor of an oversized bully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Marut.
A marut is tasked with hunting mortals who cheat death by artificially extending their lifespans. This includes those who seek undeath, such as liches and vampires, but also includes those who use powerful magic to cling to their youth, use divination to discover and avoid an appointed death, or call too often on the power of resurrection. Once the marut has selected its target, the inevitable pursues its quarry without surcease or deviation until either it or the target is dead.
Maruts seem to be carved from stone and clad in golden armor, yet they move with the deliberate grace of a creature made of flesh and bone. A marut never rushes, but its thunderous footfalls are relentless as it pursues its target. Though able to speak any language, the marut is taciturn even among inevitables.
As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons’ war against imbalance—particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos.
Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the “Convergence.” At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons — but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How—or if—this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves.
Whether the aeons serve an actual divinity, a philosophical concept, or merely a “supreme oneness” is a topic hotly debated by planar scholars. The aeons themselves are silent, referring to this being or concept as the Monad, a “condition of all.” Regardless of what the Monad actually is, there certainly exists another category of powerful aeons—the primal inevitables, each a unique demigod with its own powers and goals. Relatively few primal inevitables remain today, for nearly three-quarters of their irreplaceable kind have fallen in the endless battle with the inexorable forces of entropy.
Aeons are among the least understood of the Great Beyond’s immortal creatures, and they have a wide range of powers and abilities. Far more aeons exist than those presented here, including guardians of time like the four-armed bythos and the weirdly symmetrical theletos, which moderates the duality between freedom and fate.
To mortals, aeons sometimes seem to combine elements that are fundamentally incompatible, whether it's an aeon combining opposing concepts, or axiomites and inevitables mixing the organic with the mathematical or mechanical. Aeons see no paradox in this, but rather claim it is an expression of the underlying unity of all things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Mastodon.
Not to be confused with the larger mammoth, mastodons are primeval elephants who dwell predominantly in temperate forests. There, they travel in close-knit social groups and feed on the forest vegetation.
Elephant tusks are a highly sought-after treasure, the ivory from a single tusk potentially fetching hundreds of gold coins. Those who value the elephant’s majestic presence are impassioned defenders of the creatures, making the hunt for ivory dangerous.
Elephants of all species are, by nature, social creatures who form strong bonds with one another, but when an elephant separates from its herd—either due to tragedy or an individual streak of viciousness—they become known as rogue elephants. These dangerous solitary creatures are ill-tempered and quick to attack anything that approaches them, and often have the elite adjustments to their statistics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Mechanical Carny.
Mechanical carnies are constructs manufactured to serve as entertainers, cleaners, and guards at carnivals and circuses. The first of these constructs was created by a gnome inventor who yearned for a tireless companion who could make her laugh and smile. Her invention was so successful that it has spawned countless imitations and knockoffs throughout the Inner Sea, and mechanical carnies of some form or another are a staple throughout metropolitan lands in both Avistan and Garund. Other Mechanical Carnies The statistics here represent a relatively simple mechanical carny; the extravagance and range of a mechanical carny’s abilities are limited only by the skill and imagination of its creator. To represent other kinds of mechanical carnies, you can swap out the mechanical carny’s Berserk and Berserk Slam abilities with one of the following.
Bounce Back Requirement The mechanical carny takes damage from a melee attack; Effect The mechanical carny wobbles violently to and fro, making two headbutt Strikes: the first against the creature (if any) on the opposite side of itself from the creature that triggered this reaction and the second against the creature that triggered this reaction.
Spring-Loaded Jump (move) The mechanical carny leaps up to 25 feet into the air and lands within 25 feet (or a distance equal to the height of the carny’s jump, if fewer) of where it started, taking no falling damage.
Water Cannon (water) The mechanical carny sprays a 15-foot cone of water, dealing 2d6+4 nonlethal bludgeoning to creatures in the area (DC 18 basic Reflex save) and extinguishing any non-magical fires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Medusa.
Monstrous humanoids that resemble humans with snakes instead of hair, medusas are best known for their petrifying gazes that—if lingered upon—can permanently transform mortals to stone. Medusas are shrewd and manipulative adversaries who collect and covet secrets, and who use threats and guile to exploit the fears of weaker creatures. A medusa may seek out powerful magic items, use divination magic to discover secret knowledge and unlock forbidden power, or infiltrate a society to beguile influential politicians. Their ability to worm their way into powerful organizations makes them natural leaders of criminal out ts and thieves’ guilds, and their interest in magical phenomena leads some to pursue careers as oracles who offer to help adventurers find what they seek—for a price. Of course, if wit and deception proves insufficient, a medusa can always simply turn rivals into ornate stone decorations with little more than a glare.
Exceptionally agile and surprisingly hardy, a medusa rarely backs down from a conflict even when cornered. Many adventurers who thought themselves readied to resist the effects of a medusa’s gaze have nevertheless fallen to a medusa, as these creatures are also often deadly archers able to riddle their foes with venom-coated arrows from a distance. Still, a medusa may barter for their life if no alternatives remain, and the secrets carried by these powerful villains often make it more than worth sparing the monster’s life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Megalania.
Megalanias, like their smaller cousins the giant monitor lizards, strike fast and use their powerful bite to grip their prey. They prefer to swallow their prey whole rather than risk others getting a bite of a hard-won meal.
Giant lizards can be found in all temperate or tropical climates, often in relatively close proximity to smaller villages or rural regions where they can be a dangerous threat to livestock or travelers. The two lizards presented here tend to dwell in warmer regions— jungles for giant chameleons, and savannas for megalanias.
Giant lizards are often used as mounts or guardians or kept as pets, but never so often or as traditionally as they are by lizardfolk. The kinship these people share with giant lizards is unmistakable, valuing their companionship to an extent that equals or even exceeds that which other societies have for popular animal companions like dogs and horses.
The three species of giant lizard presented here are but the most common of their kind encountered in the wilds. Stories of much larger lizards persist, including the immense, 20-foot-long monster known as a megalania, a truly enormous version of the giant monitor lizard capable of swallowing creatures whole. Less dangerous is the giant chameleon, although its ability to blend into its environs makes it a much more insidious and stealthy threat than the lumbering, mighty megalania.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Megalodon.
Prehistoric sharks of incredible size, strength, and ferocity, megalodons scour waters deep and shallow to sate their considerable hunger. The presence of a megalodon undeniably affects the local aquatic ecosystem.
Contrary to popular belief, sharks are not particularly fond of humanoids as meals. Only under the right conditions—such as when food is scarce or the shark mistakes its victim for a seal—will a shark attack a swimmer or small boat. Such occasions are traumatic enough for survivors to perpetuate the myth of shark as maneater.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Megaprimatus.
The megaprimatus is among the mightiest of apes, quick to confront any perceived intrusions into its domain. With a height of 40 feet, it towers over even most giants, and is used to being the top-tier predator in the region.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Meladaemon (Famine Daemon).
Meladaemons personify death by starvation and thirst, and revel in spreading the same despair that brought about their mortal demise. When they aren't blighting fields, massacring livestock, or tainting water supplies, they experiment on prisoners to study how long creatures can go without sustenance and the deleterious effects that result from such deprivation. Fiercely loyal to Trelmarixian, Horseman of Famine, they serve no other beings. They work alongside other daemons if Trelmarixian wills it, but are notoriously traitorous.
While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals’ fear.
While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane of pure evil for only the most corrupt souls. If Hell is a realm of torture and systematic depravity, Abaddon is its twisted cousin—a place where one can find only misery and despair in ample quantities, with neither the strictures of Hell nor the chaotic freedom of the Abyss. For evildoers who seek simply to inflict their wickedness on others, Abaddon is a rich hunting ground where one can revel in turpitude, though visitors be forewarned: the competition is fierce.
The four Horsemen are the most powerful of the daemonic demigods, but they are only four of many. Far more daemonic harbingers dwell on Abaddon, each a unique and powerful demigod in their own right that enjoys sweeping influence among daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector (ruler of the slave city of Awaiting Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian (consort to the Horseman of Famine), and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame (patron to arsonists and agent of the Horseman of War) are but three of the dozens of harbingers who rule realms in Abaddon.
Each of the four Horsemen is served by a specific category of servitor daemons known as deacons. Leukodaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Pestilence. Meladaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Famine, while thanadaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Death. Purrodaemons are currently the most powerful of the deacons, and serve the Horseman of War—yet over time, which category of deacon is the most powerful can wax and wane.
Numerous powerful and unique daemon demigods, known collectively as harbingers, rule over swaths of Abaddon. Above these demigods, though, are entities of even greater power—the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. As the eons go on, the names and identities of specific horsemen change. Currently, they consist of Apollyon (Horseman of Pestilence), Charon (Horseman of Death), Szuriel (Horseman of War), and Trelmarixian (Horseman of Famine). Of these, only Charon has never fallen to an upstart. Some hold that a “Fifth Horseman” once ruled over the other four, while others maintain that the eternally eclipsed sun in the skies above Abaddon is all that remains of this long-dead god.
As many daemons exist as there are awful ways to die. The bloody sangudaemon personifies death by blood loss, while the skeletal thanadaemon represents death from old age. The most powerful daemons are the olethrodaemons, who represent the massive deaths caused by apocalypses and the end of entire worlds.
Daemons often carry soul gems either as trophies or for powering an ability. Cacodaemons are the most common source for soul gems, but they can also be created by spells like bind soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem to power an ability, the trapped soul is released into the afterlife and can be resurrected normally.
Soul gems are traded in illicit markets, a tradition celestials and psychopomps alike find vile. Soul gems' value varies, but is generally worth an amount relative to the level of a gem's captive soul.
Daemons embody a fundamental paradox—while they are incarnations of death and seek to devour all that lives, they are themselves living creatures. Some speak of a glorious end time after which reality will finally be free of the contagion that is life itself. Most daemons give no thought to this paradox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Melody On The Wind.
This cloud of song and sound has been caught by the wind and carried across the air. While the melody on the wind (known by some as a song elemental, despite the fact that no such place as a plane of song exists in the known multiverse) might enjoy the beauty of music, it is by nature a destructive elemental force.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Merfolk Warrior.
Merfolk warriors form the bulk of the militias of their vast underwater realms and meet potential aggressors head-on with uncompromising force.
Some sailors claim that merfolk face a grave threat—a dark and sinister power capable of rendering even the most beautiful merfolk into a degenerate and mutated wretch. Such stories often end with claims that the merfolk, proud and noble as they seem, are unwitting puppets to some unknown entity lurking in the deepest depths of the seas. Merfolk themselves are characteristically tight-lipped about such claims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Merfolk Wavecaller.
Merfolk wavecallers use their primal power to call forth allies and defend their people with deadly magic.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Mimic.
Thought to be the result of a failed experiment meant to animate objects or a sinister alghollthu creation, mimics are clever monsters that can take the form of common manufactured objects. Mimics are ambush predators and voracious eaters, surprising their prey through their uncanny ability to mimic the form of common furniture and miscellany. They remain disguised until unsuspecting adventurers happen by, then they lash out in ambush.
Mimics possess complex alien minds, and while often cruel and self-serving, they also enjoy conversation with their prey from time to time. For unknown reasons, they are especially interested in humanoids. Mimics have a strong dislike for others of their kind and tend to live alone. A mimic can remain in its alternate form for an extremely long period of time, sometimes remaining disguised in a dungeon chamber for decades. Regardless of how long it waits, the mimic remains vigilant and alert, ready to strike at any moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Minotaur.
Minotaurs are master hunters that dwell in cunning labyrinths or tangles of underground caverns meant to disorient and demoralize prey. These monstrous tormentors delight in the hunt, in the terror caused by closing in on prey, and in the very moment when the hunted realizes that they have lost the game. Only then will the minotaur charge in for the kill, cutting foes down with powerful strikes or impaling them on its sharp horns.
Minotaurs are known to dwell in mazes, but they can also be found hiding in old ruins and other forgotten corners of the world. In any case, they are solitary creatures, only rarely sharing territory with others of their kind or even more powerful beings that have cowed them into service. Everyone else is little more than prey to be hunted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Mist Stalker.
The tentacled mist stalker shrouds itself in a cloak of mist through which its single, never-blinking eye can see with clarity, allowing it an advantage when stalking its prey.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like.

Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Though fire and water classically oppose one another, in the right mixture they can become a dangerous combination. Water elementals heated to a scalding temperature through natural factors such as underwater volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent fire damage with their Strikes, while fire elementals infused with moisture might exude clouds of obscuring or even blinding steam.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Mitflit.
Mitflits, also known as mites, are self-loathing and pitiful cowards, easily bullied into servitude by other creatures or even slightly more powerful mitflit leaders. They tame insects, spiders, and other such creatures to serve as faithful allies. Mitflits have lost most of their ancestral gremlin magic, leaving these incomplete beings full of doubt and insecurity. Mitflits find companionship in the other base creatures of the world, and forge bonds of friendship with vermin, the only other beings that seem willing to accept them. A social structure, even one in which they are bullied, partially fills the hole within mitflits’ personalities, and they rarely rebel or rail out unless their rage hits a breaking point.
All gremlins are hoarders, and their nests are cluttered with objects both valuable and worthless. Sorting through a gremlin nest can reveal unexpected treasures like pieces of jewelry or minor magic items, but care must also be taken to avoid being cut on rusty shards of metal, picking up cursed items, or disturbing a hidden nest of venomous vermin.
Superstitious societies sometimes hang tiny bells made of semiprecious metals in the belief that such bells will dissuade gremlins from destroying an affixed object or infesting a home. Strangely enough, most gremlins believe this superstition as well, and even when a gremlin bell hasn’t been magically enhanced, a gremlin usually won’t risk tinkering with objects that seem to be protected in such a manner.
Lawful evil gremlins are sometimes drawn to the worship of archdevils, though not in an orthodox fashion. Dispater is revered as the archdevil of cities—playgrounds to engage in thievery and sabotage. Mammon is worshipped as the bringer of wealth and protector of gremlin warrens that, like his domain of Erebus, are dark and trap-filled. Neutral evil gremlins have been known to worship Norgorber in his aspect as a patron of thieves, but pugwampis in particular prefer to worship gnolls (or at least, worship whoever the local gnolls worship). Chaotic evil gremlins often revere Andirifkhu, demon lord of illusions, knives, and traps. Those that retain a connection to the First World may swear allegiance to the Lantern King, Eldest of laughter, mischief, and transmutation.
Most know better than to employ gremlins, so when the fey creatures live side-by-side with others, it's often as parasites and unwelcome guests. Imaginative and sinister folk who find themselves infested sometimes catch the gremlins and release them in the homes of their enemies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Mohrg.
The weight of murder wears heavy on the soul. With souls marked by a lifetime of dealing death, these killers, whether mass murderers, bloodthirsty soldiers, or sadistic executioners, sometimes do not let judgment and lawful execution stanch their slaying sprees. When such individuals are brought to justice, they may rise after death as mohrgs to continue their ruinous work.
Drawn to others of their kind, mohrgs prefer to hunt in small groups, occasionally in partnership with weaker free-willed undead such as shadows and wights. They seek out weak prey and revel in causing drawn-out suffering. Some mohrgs haunt locations they favored in life, reenacting old crimes on new victims. They may even skulk about in public, wearing rags, cloaks, or freshly harvested skins to hide their nature. The most dangerous mohrgs are those who grow powerful enough to no longer fear being struck down again and openly assault settlements in an attempt to turn living towns into mass graves.
Since those slain by a mohrg rise soon thereafter as mohrg spawn, the murders of a mohrg rarely go unnoticed for long, even when they take extra care to prey only on a society's dregs. Since mohrg spawn remain under a mohrg's control, a canny mohrg might order its spawn to remain in hiding to keep its presence secret until a point where it feels confident unleashing its undead army upon a doomed settlement. Mohrgs retain a twisted sentimentality for the crimes of their mortal life, seeking out trinkets that remind them of favorite murders. When not out hunting, mohrgs arrange their mementos into disturbing shrines. Often, these trinkets are valuable objects, and might even provide important clues to ongoing mysteries.
Mohrg Spawn When a creature returns after death as a mohrg spawn, its flesh decays away save for its entrails, and it grows a long, awful tongue. The creature gains the undead trait and becomes chaotic evil, and it loses any abilities that come from it being a living creature. It gains darkvision, negative healing, and the mohrg's immunities and resistances. If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an unarmed attack that deals slashing damage). The creature also gains a tongue Strike, an agile attack that causes paralysis, as the mohrg ability; the Fortitude save uses the DC for the mohrg spawn's level. Mohrg spawn cannot create mohrg spawn of their own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Mokele-Mbembe.
Mokele-mbembes are large, reptilian predators found deep within Golarion’s jungles. Mwangi view mokele-mbembes as embodiments of nature’s strength and majesty, and they consider the sighting of this rare being a sign of favor from the gods and an omen of powerful natural forces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Monadic Deva (Soul Angel).
Monadic devas stand vigil along the River of Souls as it passes from the mortal realm into the Ethereal Plane. Those who seek to fish souls out for their own use stalk this metaphysical river, and it is against these predators that monadic devas fight. At other times, monadic devas work to guide newcomers to the River of Souls who might be in danger of drifting from the current and lingering as ghosts. Monadic devas often find their tasks place them in alliances with psychopomps, and they work well with the monitors despite the philosophical divide between their views on a soul's inherent goodness. A monadic deva is 7 feet tall and weighs 220 pounds.
The most powerful angels belong to a category of demigods known as the empyreal lords—a title shared with other powerful good-aligned demigods among the host of archons, azatas, and other inhabitants of the celestial planes. The most powerful and most well-known of the angelic empyreal lords is Sarenrae.
Angels normally live on Nirvana or other celestial planes, but their missions can bring them to the Material Plane. Spellcasters can conjure them for aid or advice in times of need, and they can even be found, if rarely, crusading against fiends in Hell, the Abyss, or anywhere in between.
Many angels wear exquisite armor or wield beautiful and often magical weapons. While they are not hampered by mortal sins like greed or pride (save for the very rare and tragic exception), they do enjoy the beauty of fine clothing, exquisite jewelry, and works of art.
The most powerful angels are known as the solars, but numerous others can be found in Nirvana working their own missions or goals. Angels generally appear as beautiful, often somewhat androgynous humanoids, and the most powerful often possess two or even four sets of feathered wings.
Three types of devas exist among the angelic host, all of which serve as angelic “field agents.” Of the types of angels, devas are the ones most likely to be encountered dwelling somewhere other than Nirvana, as these angels focus their work on cultivating and protecting goodness in mortal souls, be they living or dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Moonflower.
These enormous plants have thick, knotted trunks festooned with fanged blossoms. A gaping mouth sits at the top of the trunk, capable of swallowing most creatures smaller than the moonflower whole. Moonflowers can move slowly on their powerful roots or use them to attack, but usually they dig them deeply into the surrounding ground and remain stationary to await prey.
Though moonflowers can't speak in the conventional sense, they communicate telepathically with other moonflowers. Explorers who encounter a single moonflower can thus be assured that any other moonflowers in the vicinity will be prepared for them. Those who manage to intercept a moonflower's telepathic communications are assaulted by visions of dreadful, primeval jungles ruled over by titanic plant life. Whether this is some vision of the past or a dream of the future shared by all moonflowers is unknown.
Moonflowers are alien life-forms from a long-dead planet, but their proliferation throughout the galaxy has been ensured through the machinations of the Dominion of the Black, a sinister, alien organization from the dark places between the stars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Morlock.
Originating from humans long lost from the world of light, morlocks are brutal monsters that dwell in the tangled tunnels of the upper reaches of the Darklands. Their wiry frames mask the strength of their limbs and their swift reactions, and their arms are long enough that they can drop into an uncanny, four-limbed shuffle for speed or stealth. They no longer remember the lives their ancestors led on the surface, although many morlocks still dwell in the shattered ruins of their ancient homes. Some morlocks worship the statues of humans from these bygone eras as gods, but others now worship Lamashtu, Rovagug, or other violent deities.
Morlock young are insatiable and clamor for even the slightest morsel of food, even consuming their siblings if no other meal presents itself. Most morlocks encourage the practice to ensure their ancestral group as a whole grows stronger.
A typical morlock stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs roughly 150 pounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Morrigna.
Bounty hunters and investigators, morrignas seek out creatures that thwart death or interfere with the natural flow of souls. Morrignas dress in flowing spider silk and wear masks reminiscent of webs, as they consider patient and watchful spiders to be their spiritual kin.
Nosois and morrignas are far from the only of their kind. Many others, like the skeletal vanths or the draconic yamarajes, also aid in the stewardship of the dead.
Psychopomps rarely oppose celestials or fiends. In fact, they frequently host such creatures in the Boneyard, particularly in the sprawling psychopomp courts where these outsiders petition for one soul or another to be remanded to their jurisdiction. Complicated cases are judged by yamarajes, while the thorniest or most politically delicate are handed by Pharasma herself.
Psychopomps' greatest enemies are creatures that devour or steal souls, such as astradaemons and night hags. Their other opponents include necromancers, proteans, and those who have unnaturally extended their lifespan, such as liches.
Some psychopomps view their task of sorting souls as ultimately hollow and meaningless, since the multiverse itself must one day end. Eons ago, these rebels shirked their duties and fled to the empty corners of the planes, becoming a new type of evil creature called a sahkil. Sahkils feed on mortal fears, particularly fears of death, and enjoy tormenting those who must die. Psychopomps generally leave these malcontents alone, except when sahkils interfere with the proper flow of souls.
The most powerful of the psychopomps are unique demigods known collectively as “ushers,” each of whom has its own cult. These psychopomp divinities include Atropos, the Last Sister; Barzahk, the Passage; Ceyanan, the Shepherd; Dammar, the Denied; Imot, the Symbol of Doom; Mother Vulture, the Flesheater; Mrtyu, Death's Consort; Narakas, the Cleansing Sentence; the Pale Horse; Phlegyas, Consoler of Atheists; Saloc, Minder of Immortals; Teshallas, the Primordial Poison; and Vale, the Court of the Ancestors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Movanic Deva (Guardian Angel).
Movanic devas are stewards of the flow of good creatures' souls through the cycle of life and death, from the point a creature is born to the day it dies. These angels arise from the souls of stalwart nurturers and protectors, and share a specific connection with a creature's vital essence—its life force. Movanic devas are most concerned with guiding and protecting good creatures during their mortal lives, so once a soul has passed into the River of Souls, the movanic deva leaves its protection to the soul angels, or monadic devas. As part of their stewardship over good creatures, movanic devas can waken within animals a level of sapience to allow them to become kindly and benevolent as well, thus increasing the flow of goodness into the afterlife. They also spend time patrolling the Positive Energy Plane and Negative Energy Plane, seeking to contain significant threats to life.
The most powerful angels belong to a category of demigods known as the empyreal lords—a title shared with other powerful good-aligned demigods among the host of archons, azatas, and other inhabitants of the celestial planes. The most powerful and most well-known of the angelic empyreal lords is Sarenrae.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Mudwretch.
In its resting form, a mudwretch looks like a large puddle of thick, dark mud, heaped at the center in a slightly drier patch of loam. When a living creature approaches, though, the mudwretch lurches upward, piling its muddy flesh upon itself to form a roughly humanoid shape, often in vague mockery of the approaching creature's general form in cases where the creature is a humanoid itself.
Mudwretches possess a low level of intellect, and while they do not form societies or cultures of their own, they are attracted to ruins or abandoned settlements. They have little need to eat, but without a constant source of moisture, a mudwretch dries out, suffering from low throbbing aches until it can resaturate. Often, blood from living creatures has to do—a dried mudwretch is more dangerous to intruders than one that's comfortably wallowing on a river bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Mukradi.
Fearsome centipede-like creatures, mukradis are three-headed predators with a devastating array of breath weapons. A Darklands version of the mukradi is rumored to exist. It’s said these variant mukradis have black scales, and all of their heads spew a black, acidic goo that animates before being reabsorbed by the mukradis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Mummy Guardian.
The majority of mummies were created by cruel and selfish masters to serve as guardians to protect their tombs from intruders. The traditional method of creating a mummy guardian is a laborious and sadistic process that begins well before the poor soul to be transformed is dead, during which the victim is ritualistically starved of nourishing food and instead fed strange spices, preservative agents, and toxins intended to quicken the desiccation of the flesh. The victim remains immobile but painfully aware during the final stages, where its now-useless entrails are extracted before it’s shrouded in funerary wrappings and entombed within a necromantically ensorcelled sarcophagus to await intrusions in the potentially distant future. While it’s certainly possible to use other methods to create a mummy guardian from an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these foul undead as their guardians in the afterlife often feel that such methods result in inferior undead—the pain and agony of death by mummification being an essential step in the process.
Regardless of the method of their creation, mummy guardians are more than just physical shells of flesh and bone—they retain fragmented, distorted versions of their minds, with only enough memories of their living personality remaining to fuel their undead anger and jealousy of those who yet live. This burning rage only intensifies over the centuries of waiting within a crypt for the chance to actually act, and thus when most mummy guardians are awoken by tomb robbers or adventurers, they stop at nothing in pursuit of glorious slaughter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Mummy Pharaoh.
While mummy guardians are undead crafted from the corpses of sacrificed—usually unwilling victims—and retain only fragments of their memories, a mummy pharaoh is the result of a deliberate embrace of undeath by a sadistic and cruel ruler. The transformation from life to undeath is no less awful and painful, but as the transition is an intentional bid to escape death by a powerful personality who fully embraces the blasphemous repercussions of the choice, the mummy pharaoh retains its memories and personality intact. Although in most cases a mummy pharaoh is formed from a particularly depraved ruler instructing their priests to perform complex rituals that grant the ruler eternal unlife, a ruler who was filled with incredible anger in life might spontaneously arise from death as a mummy pharaoh without undergoing this ritual. Depending on the nature of the ruler, a mummy pharaoh might have spellcasting or other class features instead of its Attack of Opportunity and disruptive abilities—the exact nature of the abilities the ruler had in life can significantly change or strengthen the mummy pharaoh presented here (which represents the least powerful variety of this deadly undead foe).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Muse Phantom.
For performers who die before their time and whose love of the theater is stronger than death’s grasp, the show does indeed go on. Such actors rise from the grave to become muse phantoms—undead spirits that haunt opera houses or auditoriums and possess the bodies of living actors to continue their art.
A host is often utterly unaware of being possessed by a muse phantom. Like egotistical parasites, muse phantoms assume command of their unwitting thespian shells only during big shows with packed audiences, and even then the host might chalk up their sudden lack of control to the transcendence of performance, not the nefarious influence of some paranormal entity. In time, a performer’s mind can become utterly warped by the spirit’s domination, twisting artistic temperament and vanity into evil selfishness and tireless obsession.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Mu Spore.
A mu spore is a thankfully rare fungoid monstrosity of vast power and strange intellect. Even the smallest mu spores are never less than a hundred feet long from tentacle tip to tentacle tip, yet despite this vast bulk, they are capable of flying with an uncommon grace, venting jets of foul-smelling spores to guide their flight.
Many societies tell tales of vast mu spores appearing over cities at the dawn of apocalyptic events, but they’re more than just ravenous eaters of nations. Mu spores often possess rare or esoteric knowledge, and if peaceful contact can be made, this lore can be quite valuable. Their spores can also be used to craft certain foul drugs or deadly alchemical poisons, but harvesting these ingredients is dangerous, as the spores are not viable for long once they’ve been shed, forcing alchemists seeking to harvest them to operate in perilously close proximity to the abominations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Muurfeli.
Whereas typical djinn can cleanse or clear areas with their arcane winds, the air magic of muurfeli is tainted by the Black Desert's noxious radiation and mixed with the realm's ambient fetid winds.
Genies of the Black Desert do not personify the four elements of the Elemental Planes as they do elsewhere in the cosmos. Rather, blightburn genies combine their innate elemental powers with the features of the desert to summon powerful, perverted versions of natural phenomena such as electric sandstorms or acid rain.
In addition to muurfeli and arardas, other blightburn genies can also be found in the Black Desert, including black, doglike efreet called suayiks and laanums, amorphous marid-like horrors with the heads of powerful sea serpents. Darklands equivalent of jann may exist, though they supposedly only appear to the hopelessly lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Nabasu (Gluttony Demon).
Nabasus are birthed directly into the Material Plane from the Abyss, an invasive infestation that releases the newly formed and ravenously hungry demons directly into the midst of their favored prey: mortal life. Nabasus feed on sapient creatures, but they never quite manage to sate their eternal hunger, even as they grow more and more powerful. Once they have sufficiently feasted, the demons become worthy to make the return trip to the Abyss, where they undergo a vile transformation, finally digesting their accumulated meals and deforming further into powerful vrolikais.
Nabasus form from the souls of evil gluttons, particularly from cannibals, blood-drinkers, and those who prefer the tang of undead flesh.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications. For planar ally, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.
The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.
The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.
Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.
When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.
The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.
The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.
While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.
Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Naiad.
Naiads protect streams, ponds, springs, and other natural bodies of fresh water. While most naiads lead solitary lives close to their chosen ward, sometimes these nymphs congregate in coven-like groups where river tributaries meet, performing great magic and blessing the waters of the land. Because naiads’ bonds to their bodies of water permit more flexibility, they are the nymphs most likely to interact with humanoids and even visit their settlements on occasion. Unlike other nymphs, naiads occasionally become adventurers, especially when dark forces seek to despoil nature or otherwise threaten the land, joining forces with others to prevent the corruption of nature.
Nymph queens are powerful nymphs that rule over entire regions of untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds. Every variety of nymph can have a queen. Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad queens as simply “nymphs.”
A nymph queen is 6 to 10 levels higher than an ordinary nymph of the same type, with enhanced numerical statistics and improved Strikes to match. A nymph queen’s ward is a significant region, and she strengthens and vivifies this territory with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the corresponding ability (such as a dryad’s tree dependent ability); instead, they gain the tied to the land ability, as described below. A nymph queen also gains the nymph’s beauty aura and the Focus Beauty action, which have varying effects based on the queen’s original type. She gains the Inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the Change Shape ability to change her form. Finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a druid of her level.
Change Shape (polymorph, primal, transmutation) Nymph queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking version of their natural form.
Focus Beauty (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal, visual) The nymph queen focuses her beauty upon a target within her aura. The creature must attempt a Will save. On a failure, it is affected as if by the nymph queen’s nymph’s beauty aura; if it was already affected by the aura, it suffers a greater effect described in the nymph queen’s entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn.
Inspiration (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) A nymph queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with the nymph queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves.
If a nymph queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and the nymph queen is that bard’s muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.
Nymph’s Beauty (aura, emotion, enchantment, mental, primal, visual) 30 feet. Creatures that start their turn in the aura must succeed at a Will save or suffer an effect described in the nymph queen’s entry.
Tied to the Land A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region, such as a forest for a dryad queen. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals such as blight that would harm the environment, using her Spell DC with a counteract level equal to the highest-level druid spell she can cast. When the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region.
Nymphs are living manifestations of beauty and grace, and as such they are often the subjects of art—sculpture and paintings in particular. Promising a nymph to immortalize them in a work of art can be an excellent way to secure that nymph’s favor, but one should take care to ensure that the nymph admires and is proud of the artistic effort’s final result, lest the nymph be insulted and lash out with her powerful magic.
Nymphs tend to be closely associated with specific areas of natural splendor and beauty—woodlands for dryads, rivers for naiads. Areas where nymphs dwell always look more pristine, breathtaking, and scenic than they would otherwise.
Nymphs sometimes carry magical trinkets or wear enchanted clothing or jewelry, but the greatest treasure a nymph queen can share is often her inspiration to those seeking a muse.
Naiads and dryads are the most well-known nymphs, but others exist as well. Hesperides, for example, are wards of the sunset and golden light and can be encountered dwelling on coastal cliffsides or remote islands. Lampads, on the other hand, are dark, moody nymphs found in wondrous, crystal-lined caverns deep underground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Naiad Queen.
Naiad queens rule over pristine wildernesses centered on untouched lakes or other bodies of fresh water. Bards’ songs and artists’ paintings of nymphs tend to depict naiad queens in their slightly more humanoid forms, which they don when they make the rare journey into civilized lands to garner allies or gauge threats.
Most naiad queens treat those who respect their domains with kindness, but they are fierce and quick in eliminating foes. Their blinding beauty and breadth of offensive spells make naiad queens fierce opponents if forced into a fight.
Nymph queens are powerful nymphs that rule over entire regions of untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds. Every variety of nymph can have a queen. Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad queens as simply “nymphs.”
A nymph queen is 6 to 10 levels higher than an ordinary nymph of the same type, with enhanced numerical statistics and improved Strikes to match. A nymph queen’s ward is a significant region, and she strengthens and vivifies this territory with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the corresponding ability (such as a dryad’s tree dependent ability); instead, they gain the tied to the land ability, as described below. A nymph queen also gains the nymph’s beauty aura and the Focus Beauty action, which have varying effects based on the queen’s original type. She gains the Inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the Change Shape ability to change her form. Finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a druid of her level.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Najra Lizard.
Among the smallest breeds of dragon on Golarion, these savage, cunning hunters dwell near the oases that dot the inhospitable Narhari Desert in Vudra. Land-bound, they scamper across the badlands on four short limbs, their speckled brown and yellow bodies blending into the terrain.
Though najra lizards live and sleep alone or in mated pairs near their hunting grounds, groups of up to two dozen work in unison to hunt. The lowest-ranked members of a najra lizard swarm leave their hidden dens to target prey with their parching spit. Once the unquenchable thirst caused by their venom drives the creature to the nearby watering hole, the entire swarm attacks. Even when unable to overwhelm foes with sheer numbers, najra lizards have little interest in fighting fairly. They often use their tails to rustle nearby desert scrub, hurl small stones, or otherwise divert attention so they can sneak away or attack from hiding.
Najra lizards dislike humanoids and humanoid civilization, and they are particularly rankled by being called mere “lizards.” They refer to themselves by a Draconic word that translates roughly to “swarm dragon.” Like almost all dragons, najra lizards covet shiny metals and glittering gems. They typically hide accumulated treasures in small holes near where they sleep, and arguments over such caches are one of the few things that engender violence among members of the same pack.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Nalfeshnee (Boar Demon).
Nalfeshnees are huge, corpulent, boar-headed demons that hoard treasures and knowledge alike and form from the souls of avaricious mortals. Few demons understand the inner workings of the Abyss itself like nalfeshnees, and it's not unusual for a nalfeshnee to see itself as a servitor of the Abyss itself first rather than bow before a demon lord. Some claim stewardship over the fleshy realms that birth new demons, while others guard sites of particular significance deep in the plane's secret reaches. A nalfeshnee's realm in the Abyss can easily surpass the strength and size of the largest mortal kingdoms, for nalfeshnees display a singular gift for managing and manipulating the chaos of the Abyss.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications. For planar ally, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.
The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.
The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.
Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.
When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.
The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.
The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.
While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.
Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Naunet.
Pugnacious and powerfully muscled, naunets serve as scouts and rank-and-file troops of protean armies. Resembling a thick salamander with a wide head, a powerful tail, and tentacles tipped with snapping jaws in place of rear legs, naunets are the most bestial of the proteans and occupy one of their lowest castes. Naunets are 12 feet long and weigh 900 pounds.
All proteans are prone to unpredictable fits and unexpected action, but compared to most others, naunets are much more bestial. Always ready for a fight, naunets pride themselves in acting swiftly and striking before unpleasant distractions like diplomacy can blunt a combat’s beginning.
Proteans divide themselves into a loose caste system and possess a dizzying variety of powers. Most proteans have a serpentine body with the head of a primeval beast. Scholars have long been intrigued by this fact—that scions of dissolution and disorder would share so many features—pointing out that even in the purest chaos there is some semblance of order. Others note that the serpentine form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion and lack of consensus surrounding their kind. After all, if even chaos cannot be trusted to be chaotic, would that not be the purest form of entropy?
Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves. When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature. D8Warpwave Effect 1Clumsy 2 (3 on a critical failure) 2Confused and gains 4d6 temporary Hit Points 3Dazzled (permanent on a critical failure) 4Enfeebled 2 (3 on a critical failure) 5Immobilized by filaments of energy 6Quickened (Stride, Strike, or Step only) 7Slowed 1 8Stupefied 2 (3 on a critical failure)
Among the numerous types of immortals that dwell in the Great Beyond, the proteans are surely some of the oldest. They’ve waged war against the inevitable aeons from the advent of their first creation, and speak longingly of that time before the gods themselves imposed order upon reality.
The Maelstrom, home of all proteans, is the whirling mass of turbulent primal energy, planar waves, and soul-stuff that surrounds the Outer Planes. Planar scholars theorize that all of reality was originally formed from the Maelstrom in the early days of the cosmos—a theory proteans don’t necessarily dispute.
Where proteans go, chaos follows. To proteans, there is no purer form of existence than entropy, and they constantly seek to oppose the establishment of order in the Great Beyond. However, proteans don’t see life as being incompatible with chaos; rather, they simply believe beings—immortal or not—deserve complete freedom on their own terms.
Many other proteans beyond those presented here dwell in the Maelstrom, including the spectral pelagastrs, the nearly humanoid shapechanging ourdivars, and the incredibly powerful izfiitars.
The most powerful of all proteans are a group of demigods known collectively as protean lords. Yet even their vast might pales in comparison to that of the mysterious Speakers of the Depths. The Speakers are the most enigmatic of the Maelstrom’s gods—even their exact nature is unknown, and scholars disagree as to whether they are even divinities or just aspects of the Maelstrom itself.
Individual proteans have two names: a traditional name in their hissing, confusing language; and an honorary title. The latter is easily translated to other languages, but a protean’s traditional name can only rarely be uttered in any tongue other than Protean. As such, most proteans tend to go by their titles when dealing with outsiders, referring to themselves as, for example, “Song of Gentle Poison” or “Sibilant Cry of the Storm.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Necrophidius.
Although the necrophidius is a mindless construct with no particular ability to comprehend the complexities of good or evil, these sinister-looking constructs are often crafted by evil or macabre creators seeking to imbue their guardians with a frightening aesthetic.
Constructed from bones harvested from serpents and humans, a necrophidius is animated by occult magic, not unlife. Each necrophidius is built from the skeleton of a large snake, but its skull has been replaced by that of a humanoid creature. Some death cults or particularly cruel crafters seek out the skulls of specific individuals against whom they bear grudges to provide the head for their necrophidius. The final step of the construction is the alteration of the teeth and jaws to give the creature a more serpentine visage, complete with fangs.
If a necrophidius's creator dies, the construct follows the last series of commands it was given. If it cannot do so, the necrophidius aimlessly wanders the area near where it last served its creator and attacks any creatures it encounters. Some believe that those who know the secrets of a necrophidius's origins can command it, provided its original creator no longer exists and no one else currently commands it. There are also a number of reports concerning strangely aware and intelligent necrophidiuses that roam with a purpose and track down or hunt specific living creatures they interpret as the targets of former assassination missions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Neothelid.
This gigantic, mauve worm has a hooked mouth with multiple circular bands of teeth and four barbed tongues. A wielder of terrible occult powers and a vast alien intellect, the neothelid serves the ageless horrors that dwell in strange dimensions beyond known reality—the Outer Gods and Great Old Ones of the Elder Mythos. Neothelids pass down these mysteries to the eerie wormlike creatures they spawn and create in preparation for a future where the worms below shall rule—a time when all other life is nothing more than food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Nereid.
Nereids are aquatic fey with deep ties to water. They share some similarities with naiads, but they are not guardians and do not bind themselves to a specific body of water. Although they are primarily aquatic creatures, their unique ability to imbue their vitality into a supernatural shawl allows them to travel on land as well. A nereid must be careful when manifesting a shawl, however, as their life essence is bound to it, so it can be stolen or destroyed to threaten the nereid.
Nereids prefer to exist in isolation. Left to their own devices, they avoid combat, but when forced to fight, their ability to transform the natural waters in their flesh into poison serves them as well as any weapon.
Often, ignorant sailors lump all water-dwelling fey into a single category of “aquatic tempters,” regardless of the fey's type or gender, using these creatures' names interchangeably to represent the concept of a beautiful figure who exists to lure mortals to a drowning death. Whereas naiads have more patience and often seek to educate the ignorant regarding the harm that stereotypes can cause, nereids and rusalkas have little patience for such methods. Rusalkas are the primary source for the legends of fey preying upon sailors, and nereids loathe them for that, as they prefer to live apart from humanity and enjoy the beauty of the natural world in peace.
When a nereid learns of a rusalka's increased activity, it often seeks out the rusalka to route them—not so much out of an urge to protect humanoids (in whom nereids traditionally have little interest), but to prevent the rusalka from inadvertently riling up violent responses from humanoids who can't be bothered to note the difference between a murderous fey and one who just wants to be left alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Nessian Warhound.
Believed to be bred by the Prince of Darkness himself within vast kennels in the infernal realm of Nessus, Nessian warhounds are the favored guards and hunting hounds of powerful fiends and, rarely, those mortals who worship them and have earned their favor.
On the Material Plane, these fiends are sometimes found in the service of fire-loving monsters such as fire giants or efreet, as well as mortals who seek to tame some of the raw power of Hell. In Cheliax, Hellknights occasionally call upon hell hounds to track down fugitives and traitors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Night Hag.
Night hags are thieves and merchants of mortal souls. These foul creatures collect souls in dark gems or crystalline jars to sell in fiendish markets, and are themselves empowered by potent magic jewels known as heartstones. They haunt the Ethereal Plane, where they prey upon mortals in their dreams, debilitating them with horrific nightmares as they rest. A night hag may find a particular target and haunt them continuously over the course of weeks, slowly and cruelly breaking down the victim’s will and ability to resist, until their soul is forfeit.
A night hag is a canny mastermind and soul broker, willing to consider any deal as long as she is convinced she has the upper hand. Although a night hag finds it easy to travel the Ethereal Plane and prey upon helpless souls that can’t fight back, these souls are also the least desirable to the evil outsiders the night hag bargains with, and so a night hag gathers allies and minions that allow her to prey on more potent souls without personally risking herself. Their favored minions are nightmares, with whom they share a special bond. Above all, night hags avoid fighting foes that can harry them on the Ethereal Plane, picking fights only when they are certain they can escape.
Hags are dangerous enough on their own, but when they gather in threes to form covens, they grow much more powerful.
Hags loathe all humanoid races, but not equally—the brunt of their wrath is leveled against humans. Hags prey on human society the most, adding human flesh to their cauldron and snatching newborn children before replacing the babes with their own progeny as changelings.
The four types of hags presented here are but the most notorious of their kind. Others—such as the blood hag, moon hag, storm hag, and winter hag—plague society in other regions of the world.
Some believe that hags possess no true form or body of their own, but instead manifest from society’s fear of aging. That no known male hags exist has also puzzled scholars, but perhaps this is but another way in which hags mock society—by presenting themselves as awful stereotypes of elderly women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Nightmare.
Nightmares are flaming equine harbingers of death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Nilith.
The sleek, dark niliths resemble hairless, emaciated tree sloths. These creatures are intensely dangerous and fearsome, with red glowing eyes, wicked claws, and mouths full of needlelike teeth. Niliths feed off the emotions, fears, and flesh of the living, and folktales posit that those who have nightmares of these creatures are fated to one day be eaten by them. Niliths draw intense joy from tormenting sapient creatures, often focusing their predations on the pious and the just, from whom they draw forth their most basic fears and worst thoughts and revel in their victims’ subsequent terror. More often than not, these despicable manipulators wish to drive their victims into madness and even to suicide. Most niliths lack the patience to spend too much time fully tearing down an individual, and when a nilith tires of its current plaything and becomes bored with its particular thoughts and fears, it murders the quarry before feeding on its flesh and moving onto the next victim.
Niliths are actually extensions of much deadlier creatures that dwell in a distant dimension beyond dreams—in a way, niliths are little more than remote feeding machines for the unknown alien entities to which they are connected. Scholars and dimensional travelers have attempted to uncover the exact mechanisms of this mysterious connection, but they have yet to decipher the truth. Indeed, many who investigate the nature of the nilith’s bond are driven to madness before getting anywhere close. The odd connection to otherworldly beings might help explain the longevity of these creatures, as it is believed that niliths can live for thousands of years.
Thankfully for others, niliths are solitary creatures that hate the company of their own kind, likely because these harbingers of nightmares have no wish to taste the horrors they bring to others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Nixie.
These aquatic fey often guard ponds, rivers, lakes, and springs, protecting their bucolic homes from the advances of predators and careless humanoids alike. Nixies tend to be reclusive and try to keep their presence hidden from humanoids, hoping trespassers won't give them cause to act. Stories of minor miracles granted by nixies to those they befriend encourage humanoids to seek out these reclusive fey, and ironically make it even more unlikely for a nixie to grant such a boon. On the other hand, if someone approaches a nixie with respect, or even better, a positive attitude that displays just the right amount of humility and easygoing openness, a nixie is far more likely to respond positively to any requests for aid. Often a nixie will ask those who seek their assistance to perform a task for them first; such requests can be minor acts of entertainment (such as telling a rousing story or performing a requested song), but in other cases the nixie might need more significant aid, such as driving off an unwanted local predator or investigating the source of pollution near their home.
Nixies resort to violence only if no other tactic works. They much prefer solutions that rely upon primal magic to defuse conflicts before they can escalate to bloodshed. In pursuit of such resolutions, nixies rely on their ability to charm individuals and, when they can establish magical influence, encourage intruders to leave peacefully. While some nixies try to confuse intruders and subtly guide them from the area, others use local animals and beasts to scare off trespassers. Occasionally, nixies recruit charmed humanoids to act as protectors or help with a task that is simply too big for them to deal with. If this task is underwater, nixies use their magic to temporarily grant the ability to breathe water to the charmed creature. Only those who manage to befriend a nixie are given invitations to return to swim or dine with the fey, and only the most trusted of allies are granted a minor wish.
Nixies appear as aquatic humanoids the size of a child, with large eyes, catfish-like whiskers, and webbed fingers and toes. They have scaly skin, pointed ears, and long hair the color of seaweed. Nixies often form small communities, even building underwater societies if their numbers are great enough. In many cultures' folklore, there are stories of nixie nations hidden at the bottom of particularly large lakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Norn.
Ancient beyond imagining, norns are powerful fey women who hold in their hands the physical manifestation of fate and destiny in the form of golden thread. They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon—or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings.
Norns' relationship with the Eldest of the First World is complex. Many among norns serve Magdh the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies: a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns find the other Eldest even more alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the Eldest wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave to meddle with fate as much as they desire.
While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unaffiliated norn with ease, they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are spoken. These norns, for their part, use their perceived neutrality judiciously. They know better than to issue too many demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious demigods grow frustrated and tired of norns' interference. And so the balance of power remains tenuous between unaffiliated norns and the Eldest, as it has for eons. However, norns know that it's merely a matter of time before the Eldest lose their respect for this tradition and start acting entirely as they please, despite norns' best efforts to rein in their most disruptive actions.
A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.
Worshipping Norns On the Material Plane, some mortals worship norns as deities, while others, especially witches and bards, admire them as patrons or muses. Those who uphold norns as deities are known as Followers of Fate. Norns do little to discourage this veneration, but neither do they go out of their way to support such worship. Clerics who venerate norns might worship a specific norn or norn triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same benefits regardless of their choice. The religious symbol of Followers of Fate is a pair of shears cutting a golden thread, and their areas of concern are destiny, fate, and the aging process.
Norns who visit the Material Plane often do so in groups of three known as triumvirates. The norns of a triumvirate can communicate with each other telepathically over a planetary distance. Regardless of their appearance on the First World, when a norn becomes part of a triumvirate on the Material Plane, her apparent age shifts so that in each group, there always appears to be one young adult norn, one middleaged norn, and one elderly norn—a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Nosoi.
A nosoi resembles a whippoorwill, sparrow, or other small bird wearing a heavy leather plague doctor’s mask. They are the clerks, messengers, and scribes of the Boneyard, witnessing judgments, directing souls, and generally performing the administrative grunt work that keeps the Boneyard functioning. Most nosois are particularly chatty and eager to discuss how important they consider their individual assignments to be.
Nosois and morrignas are far from the only of their kind. Many others, like the skeletal vanths or the draconic yamarajes, also aid in the stewardship of the dead.
Psychopomps rarely oppose celestials or fiends. In fact, they frequently host such creatures in the Boneyard, particularly in the sprawling psychopomp courts where these outsiders petition for one soul or another to be remanded to their jurisdiction. Complicated cases are judged by yamarajes, while the thorniest or most politically delicate are handed by Pharasma herself.
Psychopomps' greatest enemies are creatures that devour or steal souls, such as astradaemons and night hags. Their other opponents include necromancers, proteans, and those who have unnaturally extended their lifespan, such as liches.
Some psychopomps view their task of sorting souls as ultimately hollow and meaningless, since the multiverse itself must one day end. Eons ago, these rebels shirked their duties and fled to the empty corners of the planes, becoming a new type of evil creature called a sahkil. Sahkils feed on mortal fears, particularly fears of death, and enjoy tormenting those who must die. Psychopomps generally leave these malcontents alone, except when sahkils interfere with the proper flow of souls.
The most powerful of the psychopomps are unique demigods known collectively as “ushers,” each of whom has its own cult. These psychopomp divinities include Atropos, the Last Sister; Barzahk, the Passage; Ceyanan, the Shepherd; Dammar, the Denied; Imot, the Symbol of Doom; Mother Vulture, the Flesheater; Mrtyu, Death's Consort; Narakas, the Cleansing Sentence; the Pale Horse; Phlegyas, Consoler of Atheists; Saloc, Minder of Immortals; Teshallas, the Primordial Poison; and Vale, the Court of the Ancestors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Nuckelavee.
When pollution despoils a natural waterway, it draws the dreaded nuckelavee to it from the First World. This spirit of wrath is a grisly sight to behold: a horselike monstrosity with the gnarled upper body of a humanoid growing directly from its back. Further enhancing the awfulness, not a patch of skin exists on the misshapen hybrid form, as though it survived its own flaying.
When a nuckelavee rides forth from its domain, it wreaks a trail of destruction across the lands surrounding its path. Nuckelavees are considered among the cruelest and most monstrous fey, seen by some as just desserts visited upon those who would befoul the waters of their homes. A nuckelavee, though, doesn't discriminate between those who pollute and those who merely have the misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Nuglub.
The "towering" hunchbacked nuglubs are among the largest gremlins, though they're not quite three feet tall. Nuglubs have three glowing blue eyes and black, oily hair on their head and back that covers them like a cloak. Nuglubs enjoy killing with a glee that other gremlins reserve for sabotage. Indeed, they spend long hours preparing ambushes for unwary travelers or plotting the murders of sleeping villagers. Though less technically inclined than their kin, nuglubs do enjoy building traps. They delight in stealthily constructing traps in places their victims consider familiar, such as front doors and the floors around beds. If someone else gets blamed for the mayhem the nuglub creates, all the better.
In combat, nuglubs focus on targets wearing metal armor. Some attribute this to envy on the part of the nuglubs, who find it difficult to fit armor on their twisted bodies. Nuglubs are particularly talented at causing those nearby to stumble over them and fall prone. Once an enemy falls to the ground, all the nuglubs descend upon the target, biting and scratching until nothing remains.
Nuglubs rarely gather in groups larger than half a dozen, as quarrels often lead to violence and cannibalism. A lone nuglub who bullies a group of smaller gremlins is more likely to get their way, and thus less likely to attack their allies.
All gremlins are hoarders, and their nests are cluttered with objects both valuable and worthless. Sorting through a gremlin nest can reveal unexpected treasures like pieces of jewelry or minor magic items, but care must also be taken to avoid being cut on rusty shards of metal, picking up cursed items, or disturbing a hidden nest of venomous vermin.
Superstitious societies sometimes hang tiny bells made of semiprecious metals in the belief that such bells will dissuade gremlins from destroying an affixed object or infesting a home. Strangely enough, most gremlins believe this superstition as well, and even when a gremlin bell hasn’t been magically enhanced, a gremlin usually won’t risk tinkering with objects that seem to be protected in such a manner.
Lawful evil gremlins are sometimes drawn to the worship of archdevils, though not in an orthodox fashion. Dispater is revered as the archdevil of cities—playgrounds to engage in thievery and sabotage. Mammon is worshipped as the bringer of wealth and protector of gremlin warrens that, like his domain of Erebus, are dark and trap-filled. Neutral evil gremlins have been known to worship Norgorber in his aspect as a patron of thieves, but pugwampis in particular prefer to worship gnolls (or at least, worship whoever the local gnolls worship). Chaotic evil gremlins often revere Andirifkhu, demon lord of illusions, knives, and traps. Those that retain a connection to the First World may swear allegiance to the Lantern King, Eldest of laughter, mischief, and transmutation.
Most know better than to employ gremlins, so when the fey creatures live side-by-side with others, it's often as parasites and unwelcome guests. Imaginative and sinister folk who find themselves infested sometimes catch the gremlins and release them in the homes of their enemies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Nyogoth.
Little more than a coiled mass of intestines encircling a massive gaping maw, this qlippoth is an Abyssal scavenger, subsisting on the filth and leftovers of demons and qlippoth alike, although it relishes any opportunity to consume living prey. Despite this seeming lowly role in the Abyssal ecosystem, a nyogoth is far from a stupid beast and can orchestrate cunning ambushes to secure its next meal.
The qlippoth presented here are but a small fraction of the squirming awfulness that lurks in the deeper rifts of the Abyss. Other types of qlippoth include multi-armed, crab-like gongorinans, which use living creatures as incubators; shapeshifting utukku, which infiltrate and undermine religions; death-spawned behimirons, which slay the living to reproduce; and the living siege engines known as catabolignes. Yet most frightening of all is the immense iathavos, a monster so abhorrent that even the Abyss cannot bear to allow more than one to exist at any one time.
Qlippoth ruled the Abyss for eons and still see themselves as its rightful rulers. When the Abyss first began to spawn demons from the souls of sinful humanoids, the realm was plunged into a brutal war spanning untold millennia, in which qlippoth, though more powerful and established, were slowly but surely driven back by the endless demonic hordes who spawned far more quickly than qlippoth could ever hope to match. Today, qlippoth have been driven to the deepest, darkest corners of the Abyss where they cling tightly to the crumbling remains of their territory.
As qlippoth lost territory to their demonic rivals, they realized that the only way to stem the tide of demonic forces was to starve them of the sinful souls that the Abyss uses to spawn new demons. While qlippoth have no concept of how they might go about preventing sin by changing the way mortals act, they do understand that exterminating mortal life would solve the problem as well.
The most powerful qlippoth are quasi-deities themselves, ancient entities only rarely worshipped by non-qlippoth. Of these monstrous divinities, the Polymorph Plague, Yamasoth, is the most well-known. Others include Chavazvug the Crawling Inferno, Isph-Aun-Vuln the Feaster Within, and Thuskchoon the Everglutton.
Although it is widely accepted that qlippoth have lost incalculable territory in the Abyss to demonkind, these fiends still control vast regions in the deepest reaches of that plane. Some sages suggest the troubling possibility that perhaps qlippoth still hold more territory of the Abyss than demons do, but because demons are more concerned with mortal life, we simply interact with the layers they control more often. For all we know, these dour sages postulate, the Abyss teems with endless swarms of qlippoth that have yet to make their move against mortal life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Obsidian Golem.
The art of golem animation is not limited to societies with access to expensive crafting materials or a long history of arcane mastery. Among the resource-poor xulgaths who dwell in the Darklands, especially those hardy clutches that call the Black Desert their home, obsidian is one of the most common crafting materials available. Combine this ingredient with a powerful spellcaster and the xulgath tradition of inflection—magically warping and working normally inflexible stone—and the end result is an obsidian golem.
Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called “golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.
Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell can affect the golem.
Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.
Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.
Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ochre Jelly.
Ochre jellies are animate masses of protoplasm with a sickly combination of yellow, orange, and brown hues. Their acidic bodies dissolve flesh but leave other materials, including a victim’s gear and bones, intact. Some ancient cultures would entomb bodies in stone sarcophaguses with ochre jellies to allow the ooze to break down the flesh and clean and polish the bones.
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms are usually found near each other, as the two oozes are part of the same life cycle. When a giant amoeba grows large enough, it can spontaneously split apart into two separate amoeba swarms, and when an amoeba swarm feeds enough, its individual components can fuse together into a single creature.
Many oozes have acidic attacks that can quickly degrade flesh, wood, and even stronger materials. Some believe that oozes are the result of alchemical or magical experimentation run amok, while others postulate that they simply emerged from the natural processes of evolution.
Many varieties of these nearly mindless predators exist in the world. Some are mere variants, with different colored puddings, jellies, and oozes with little to differentiate them from those presented here other than their habitat. Others are more specialized, or even dangerously intelligent. The shoggoth is one such example, but another variety of deadly and powerful ooze is the thankfully rare blight, a creature composed of protoplasm and eyes that curses entire regions with its presence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ofalth.
Found in castle dung heaps, city dumps, and sewers, ofalths are thought to be cousins of shamblers. But whereas shamblers are living heaps of soggy vegetation, ofalths are living heaps of matter from an altogether more unpleasant source: these monsters look like 9-foot-tall amalgamations of wet detritus, sewage, and rubbish with long tentacular arms and stout legs. It can be difficult to tell where an ofalth’s body ends and the foul contents of the cesspit they wallow within begins. They move through refuse heaps in search of organic material in their endless quest to sate their hunger.
Though ofalths have a limited intellect, they still exhibit a vile curiosity. They are no strangers to dissecting their prey after it has succumbed to their wasting disease—a terrible and aptly named affliction that causes the victim’s blood to seep from its pores. When an ofalth manages to secure a victim alive, it may even torture its food by consuming it bit by bit while it shrieks for mercy.
Ofalths’ domains typically overlap with those of otyughs, who fear ofalths, though otyughs have also been known to band together in order to take down an ofalth for its rubbery flesh, which the otyughs consider an intoxicating delicacy. On the other hand, ofalths seem to particularly enjoy taking otyughs apart one piece at a time. They have been known to keep a captured otyugh alive for days or even weeks, forcing the otyugh to endure the cloying scent of its own body decaying before the ofalth feeds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ogre Boss.
In ogre society, might makes more than right—it makes the rules. The strongest or most violent ogre in a family (in most cases, this is the same ogre) is invariably that family’s boss. Quick to hook fallen foes on their weapons, even other ogres fear the repercussions of displeasing an ogre boss. When an ogre boss barks out commands, the other members of the family move quickly to obey.
Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. Ogres practice incest regularly, believing that it makes for stronger familial bonds, and most ogres are misshapen or mutated from generations of inbreeding. The most powerful ogre in any family is the “boss”—usually the family’s patriarch or matriarch—while other ogres in the family learn to obey or risk being brutalized by the boss’s loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy. These lairs are filthy and frequently contain all-too-recognizable evidence of their depravity.
Ogre warrens are hideous abattoirs strewn with severed limbs, offal, and dubious stews. Ogres sometimes keep shiny baubles, like jewelry, and they appreciate intimidating weapons and armor, especially those that are large enough for them to use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ogre Glutton.
Ogre gluttons take the act of feeding to a horrific extreme, capable of extending their already cavernous mouths wide enough to gulp down a halfling. Stories of ogre gluttons being tricked into eating razor-edged shields or barrels filled with poisoned meat are common, but such tales are of little consolation to those who have been gobbled down whole by these ravenous giants. In addition to their sadistic table manners, ogre gluttons have a disturbing knack for coming up with violent “games” that are little more than drawn-out torments, yet those who somehow manage to beat a glutton at the rules of its own game can often enrage and frustrate the ogre enough that the resulting tantrum is more than enough distraction to afford a last-ditch escape from doom.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Ogre Spider.
These terrifying creatures grow as large as elephants. The placement of their eyes above their wide mandibles evokes the grimacing visage of an ogre's leer. Ogres themselves find the appearance of ogre spider faces simultaneously amusing and adorable, but in most cases, ogres' attempts to keep these spiders as pets result in dead ogres and well-fed spiders.
Though they are vermin incapable of forming true alliances, spiders show up alongside many types of creatures, including web lurkers. Spellcasters sometimes call upon spiders using summon animal, and spider swarms have a way of popping up just about anywhere at the most inopportune times.
A staggering number of species of giant spider exist in the world. Some, like the dream spider, whose venom creates strange hallucinations, are relatively small. Others, like the lumbering ogre spider, are larger than horses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ogre Warrior.
The simplest of ogres are slabs of muscle with hatefully beady eyes, misshapen visages, and malformed bodies. Always eager for mayhem and murder, ogre warriors are quick to turn on their kin when there’s a shortage of smaller folk to torment, so those who lead ogres do their best to keep them constantly distracted with new opportunities for raids and ruin.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Olethrodaemon (Apocalypse Daemon).
Even daemons fear the most massive and terrifying of their kind, olethrodaemons. No single entity could embody the level of evil necessary to manifest one; instead, these living war machines are made from the souls of many—or so the story goes. Other theories suggest that the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are responsible for creating the olethrodaemons, or that olethrodaemons are merely the seeping run-off of an even greater being: a mysterious fifth Horseman.
Whatever the truth, olethrodaemons are real, and their existence is terrifying enough to instill paralyzing existential dread. With dozens of unblinking glowing eyes above a drooling maw, two sets of four muscled limbs, and countless horns, olethrodaemons resemble no other creature known to mortalkind.
While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals’ fear.
While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane of pure evil for only the most corrupt souls. If Hell is a realm of torture and systematic depravity, Abaddon is its twisted cousin—a place where one can find only misery and despair in ample quantities, with neither the strictures of Hell nor the chaotic freedom of the Abyss. For evildoers who seek simply to inflict their wickedness on others, Abaddon is a rich hunting ground where one can revel in turpitude, though visitors be forewarned: the competition is fierce.
The four Horsemen are the most powerful of the daemonic demigods, but they are only four of many. Far more daemonic harbingers dwell on Abaddon, each a unique and powerful demigod in their own right that enjoys sweeping influence among daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector (ruler of the slave city of Awaiting Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian (consort to the Horseman of Famine), and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame (patron to arsonists and agent of the Horseman of War) are but three of the dozens of harbingers who rule realms in Abaddon.
Each of the four Horsemen is served by a specific category of servitor daemons known as deacons. Leukodaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Pestilence. Meladaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Famine, while thanadaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Death. Purrodaemons are currently the most powerful of the deacons, and serve the Horseman of War—yet over time, which category of deacon is the most powerful can wax and wane.
Numerous powerful and unique daemon demigods, known collectively as harbingers, rule over swaths of Abaddon. Above these demigods, though, are entities of even greater power—the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. As the eons go on, the names and identities of specific horsemen change. Currently, they consist of Apollyon (Horseman of Pestilence), Charon (Horseman of Death), Szuriel (Horseman of War), and Trelmarixian (Horseman of Famine). Of these, only Charon has never fallen to an upstart. Some hold that a “Fifth Horseman” once ruled over the other four, while others maintain that the eternally eclipsed sun in the skies above Abaddon is all that remains of this long-dead god.
As many daemons exist as there are awful ways to die. The bloody sangudaemon personifies death by blood loss, while the skeletal thanadaemon represents death from old age. The most powerful daemons are the olethrodaemons, who represent the massive deaths caused by apocalypses and the end of entire worlds.
Daemons often carry soul gems either as trophies or for powering an ability. Cacodaemons are the most common source for soul gems, but they can also be created by spells like bind soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem to power an ability, the trapped soul is released into the afterlife and can be resurrected normally.
Soul gems are traded in illicit markets, a tradition celestials and psychopomps alike find vile. Soul gems' value varies, but is generally worth an amount relative to the level of a gem's captive soul.
Daemons embody a fundamental paradox—while they are incarnations of death and seek to devour all that lives, they are themselves living creatures. Some speak of a glorious end time after which reality will finally be free of the contagion that is life itself. Most daemons give no thought to this paradox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Onidoshi.
Onidoshi, or ogre mages, are oni with the material form of an ogre. Onidoshi's supernatural prowess and overwhelming intellect are enough to awe and cow entire families of rank-and-file ogres. Because of this, onidoshi are often found at the head of ogre war parties or orchestrating these violent campaigns from behind the scenes. It's rare for onidoshi to lead solitary existences, but those who do prefer to maraud the countryside or exploit villages and hoard the spoils for themselves.
When an oni manifests, they always do so in a form that parodies a specific humanoid ancestry closely associated with the oni’s obsessions and envies. Giants’ over-the-top personalities and sizes are likely the reason why these humanoids are the most common incarnations chosen by oni; such oni are known collectively as yai oni. Yet there exist oni associated with almost every kind of humanoid. Most oni are capable of supernaturally disguising themselves as their associated humanoid type and use this ability to infiltrate societies and seize control from within. Once established, oni typically reveal their true form and revel in dominating those they view as lesser beings fit only to serve their whims.
Oni are nothing if not vain. They typically choose comely or striking appearances in their humanoid disguises—forms that are completely at odds with the ugliness of their true natures. An oni’s true form is indicative of their innermost desires and always has features such as oversized teeth that verge into tusks, sharp claws, unusually bright skin colors, or a third eye in the forehead. Oni have desires as varied as those of any being, though by their nature these desires are almost always for hedonistic or destructive experiences of the flesh, typically food, pleasure, or violence.
Oni daimyo are quasi-deities with isolated mortal domains. The most powerful is Inma, the Empress of the World, but Akuma the Horned King, Murona the Dark Mother, and Nataka the Red King are also worshipped.
The first oni originated in the nation of Minkai on the continent of Tian Xia. Whether due to prevalent local kami— particularly in the mist-shrouded Forest of Spirits—or its peoples' faiths, Minkai is a hotbed of oni activity.
Oni humanoid forms are limited to one specific appearance. An ogre magecan assume only one specific ogre form, while an ice yai can appear only as one specific frost giant. Some oni have greater control over their shapeshifting power and can assume the form of any humanoid creature, and these oni tend to be the most dangerous.
Different oni exist for nearly every humanoid ancestry. Kuwa oni mask their golden skin and four-fingered claws in human form, while ja oni hide as hobgoblins. Other yai include wind yai (who take their form from cloud giants) and the immensely powerful void yai (who form from other yai and ascend to rule over rune giants).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ooze Mephit.
Slick in every sense of the word, ooze mephits are unapologetic sycophants, shamelessly flattering anyone they may be able to con a favor out of, although their lack of intelligence and subtlety means that only the most vain or trusting targets fail to see through their honeyed words. Lacking proper bones, these ocher-colored mephits have bodies consisting primarily of ooze and muck. They smell disgusting, and their touch leaves stains that are almost impossible to get out.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Mephits are a favorite target for low-level spellcasters to summon, both because they have several useful abilities and because they are relatively easy to command and manipulate. Still, care must be taken when using mephits as minions, because if left unwatched or unattended for too long, they can cause all sorts of mischief.
Different types of mephits that can be found on the same elemental plane often develop friendly (or, in some cases, fierce) rivalries with one another. While mephits from elementally opposed planes (such as fire and water) may have strong opinions about the superiority of their own element, the fact that they rarely see such mephits means that when they do encounter them, they often get along better than they do with their close neighbors.
Perhaps because they're so often compelled into service by mortal conjurers and more powerful elementals, mephits tend to adopt long names peppered with self-proclaimed titles and imagined or exaggerated accomplishments to alleviate their feelings of inadequacy. Some examples of mephit names follow. Anothoraxia, Lurker in Dark Places, the Tragic Hero, One Against AllSilothiscil the Embittered, Rimelord of the Eternal Chill, Lord of IciclesOglophax, Prince of Pungency, the Viscous One, the Forever StainZarnozath the Magnificent, First of His Name, Boiler of Kettles, the Teapot Terror
The four mephits presented here are but the most common of their kind. Others that rise from the mixing of elemental energies exist as well: creatures like dust mephits (who breathe out a scouring cloud of grit), ice mephits (who spit out sickening gusts of frozen air), magma mephits (which can assume the form of a pool of lava), ooze mephits (which spit out foul-smelling acid), salt mephits (who can draw moisture out of the environs and nearby creatures), and steam mephits (which can call down tiny squalls of boiling rain).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Orca.
While many know orcas as “killer whales,” they are actually the largest species of dolphin. These powerful animals hunt together in pods to take down seals, sharks, and even true whales. Adult orcas are typically 15–25 feet long and weigh 8,000–12,000 pounds.
Dolphins have a somewhat unusual trait—they often come to the aid of other creatures in distress, such as to save a drowning person or to protect someone from the attack of a shark. Not every monster in this book wants to hurt player characters— consider having a dolphin come to an endangered PC's rescue if the situation merits!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Orc Brute.
If orc armies are rarely well organized, this shortcoming can likely be traced to the furious and undisciplined rank-and-file brutes who make up the bulk of an orc warband.
Physically, orcs tower over most humanoids and look practically custom-made for violence with their rough flesh, sturdy bone, and iron-hard muscle. For all their tough looks, however, orcs are far from invincible. They lack the discipline to conduct large-scale campaigns, for one thing, and they typically lose their heads in the heat of battle. Even their skin scars easily—though this is a source of pride to the orc people, since scars signify strength and experience in battle. To orcs, the crisscross of old wounds are a much a badge of pride and honor as any beheaded foe or claimed trophy.
Orcs are a people of violent passions in all that they do, not just war. Bonds of blood are especially strong among orcs, and lineage is important. The strongest orc bands are typically made up of brothers and sisters in more than arms; orcs fight harder when they are protecting their own kinsfolk, and orc warriors will fight tirelessly to avenge fallen family members. This emphasis on bloodlines is not an altruistic one, however, and is in fact a double-edged sword. Orcs whose families have been killed find themselves at the bottom of the clan’s totem pole, and even a famous chieftain can become powerless overnight if their brethren aren’t there to back them up.
The chaotic and fractious nature of orc culture results in a great variety of beliefs, superstitions, and legacies among different clans. This cultural divergence causes substantial infighting among orc bands, in many cases preventing the rise of larger orc nations. It can also frustrate many attempts at diplomacy, as the taboos of one band may be commonplace and thoroughly accepted practices among others. Navigating a specific band’s culture can often mean the difference between life and death to those who deal with orcs off the field of war. Although orcs, as a rule, rarely deal with outsiders, they recognize the benefits of trade and willingly swap resources with other violent peoples like hobgoblins, drow, and many humans.
Orcs worship violent deities that support their murderous instincts, chiefly Rovagug, but also Lamashtu and Gorum and sometimes demon lords like Nurgal and Shax.
Orcs are known for riding strange and fearsome beasts, particularly megafauna like dire wolves and smilodons. Given the opportunity, orcs also enlist drakes, manticores, and anything else big and frightening enough to suit their needs.<|endoftext|>

Orcs worship violent deities that support their murderous instincts, chiefly Rovagug, but also Lamashtu and Gorum and sometimes demon lords like Nurgal and Shax.
Orcs are known for riding strange and fearsome beasts, particularly megafauna like dire wolves and smilodons. Given the opportunity, orcs also enlist drakes, manticores, and anything else big and frightening enough to suit their needs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Oread.
Elemental earth laces through the bones of oreads, who appear similar to stone statues of their mortal ancestry, with delicate crystals in place of hair, fur, or scales. Oreads are stoic and slow to plan but are of steadfast resolve and unwavering in their convictions.
The typical oread cherishes quiet seclusion. Yet as they age, many oreads find themselves inexplicably drawn to some far-flung location with a pull like that exerted on the needle of a compass—intangible, constant, and ultimately irresistible. The destination of this mysterious pilgrimage is unique to each oread, though it usually ends in some place of great mystical power, natural splendor, or esoteric learning. Most oreads are drawn to a place with which they are somewhat familiar, but a rare few feel drawn to travel in a seemingly random direction, departing with only their hope that they'll discover whatever mystery lies at the end of their invisible path.
Many oreads find that the role of a guard suits their personality well, for in such a role they can feel as if they are helping to promote order but also find time to stand vigil as lone sentinels over a specific portion of a fortification or a remote location on a wilderness trail.
Many immortals dwell upon the other planes of the Great Beyond. Some are benevolent and kindly, like angels. Others are cruel and destructive, like demons. And some flt roles outside of morality, like psychopomps. It’s far from unheard of that mortals and immortals alike become entangled romantically, and the children of such engagements carry a supernatural element in their bloodlines for generations to follow. After the first generation, this otherworldly influence usually lies dormant, but now and then, the influence can manifest strongly in descendants many years later. These inheritors of extraplanar legacies are known collectively as planar scions.
While most geniekin planar scions live on their genie parent's ancestral plane, rare fonts of elemental power or genie activity sometimes give rise to geniekin on Golarion. By far, geniekin are most commonly found in Katapesh, as genies are more prevalent there than other regions due to the influence of genie binders.
Planar scions from the elemental planes are known as geniekin because they are overwhelmingly born from couplings between mortals and genies: ifrits are born of efreeti, oreads of shaitans, sulis of jann, sylphs of djinn, and undines of marids. Despite this distinguished ancestry, geniekin do not display most of their parents' exceptional talents, such as their ability to grant wishes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ostiarius.
Ostiariuses, as emissaries of the velstracs, tend to the portals between the Shadow Plane and the Material Plane. They not only escort other velstracs into the world of mortals, but also work to entice mortals into the realms of the velstracs— from which most mortals never leave. Among the most pleasant and persuasive of the velstracs, ostiariuses are prepared to converse for hours upon any topic, and they are skilled at returning, again and again, to the subject of the delights found in their perverse philosophies. Ostiariuses stand over 6 feet tall, and individuals range from skeletally thin to hugely corpulent.
Velstracs manifest from the souls of masochistic or sadistic mortals that are diverted into the Shadow Plane and then forged into forms that suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the aesthetics-obsessed interlocutors.
Some mortals refer to velstracs as “kytons,” a misattribution that the velstracs tolerate with cold amusement. The term “kyton” denotes a master or virtuoso among their kind, and these fiends enjoy being labeled masters of their horrid paths to perfection through agony.

Velstracs originated with the first debased thoughts of mortals, which the gods found so deplorable that they locked all velstracs away in Hell. It wasn’t long, however, before the newly formed race of velstracs escaped their infernal prison to the Shadow Plane.
Velstracs originated with the first debased thoughts of mortals, which divine beings found so deplorable that they locked all velstracs away in Hell. It wasn't long, however, before the newly formed beings escaped their infernal prison to the Shadow Plane.
Scholars grimly joke that there are as many different kinds of velstracs as there are ways to skin a cat. The relatively diminutive cantor velstrac poisons the minds of its victims so that they believe they are being clawed from the inside out. The mighty eremites, on the other hand, seek out the most powerful beings to subsume into their own form and lord over all other velstracs save the demagogues.
There are as many different velstracs as there are ways to inflict pain. Other velstracs range in power from the relatively weak lampadariuses to the powerful phylacators.
Many velstracs outsource the forging of their chains to unique velstracs known as almoners. These six-armed, legless humanoids toil endlessly at a great burning foundry called the Shadow Forge. Almoners operate under mysterious strictures, and are just as likely to turn a velstrac away empty-handed as not.
Many velstracs forge their own chains, but others outsource the task to unique velstracs known as almoners. These blind, deaf, and mute velstracs resemble six-armed halflings severed at the waist that toil away endlessly at a great burning foundry called the Shadow Forge. Almoners operate under mysterious strictures, and are just as likely to turn a velstrac away empty-handed as they are to hand one a finely crafted chain before the request has even been uttered.
The most powerful velstracs are unique divinities known collectively as demagogues—powerful creatures often worshipped by mortals who seek to experience agonizing new revelations and gain power by enhancing the body through pain.

Velstracs are most often encountered in the shadowy realm of Nidal, where the state worship of Zon-Kuthon is rigidly enforced. Indeed, many velstracs are created from the souls of Joyful Things, devotees of Zon-Kuthon who have had their limbs amputated to focus their minds on the veneration of pain, sacrifice, and torment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Osyluth (Bone Devil).
An osyluth is an unparalleled inquisitor that revels in the sadism and torture for which Hell is so well known. These devils' charge is to seek out heresies, both among mortals and among other fiends—a commandment they uphold with unwavering fervor. They spawn within the Styx-fed swamps of Hell's fifth layer, Stygia; where heresies and the souls of heretics stagnate, osyluths eventually rise. In the remote corners of that same layer of Hell, they build massive, calcified hives where they perform their vile interrogations and perfect their torturous arts upon lesser devils and petitioners alike.
At any one time, eight archdevils rule the eight upper layers of Hell, while the deepest layer is ruled by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a unique demigod with a dedicated role in guiding the infernal machine forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city. Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries, and Belial designs new weapons for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the oldest archdevil and keeper of many secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs armies. Baalzebul is a brooding archdevil who has fallen from Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty Mephistopheles was formed from the plane of Hell itself.
Many unique and powerful devils hold positions of power in Hell. The most numerous of these are the infernal dukes, many of whom were promoted to this position from already impressive statures as pit fiends. The supreme ruler of Hell itself is Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness. Between these two tiers rule the eight archdevils—see the sidebar on the facing page.
The nine layers of Hell are the planar home of all devils, and they much prefer its tyrannically ordered environs to anywhere else in the multiverse. Yet devils can be encountered anywhere mortals can be tempted by infernal bargains or seek diabolic aid. On Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is particularly aligned with Hell. Its government is based upon Hellʼs organization, and the state church is that of Asmodeus.
Devils view daemonsʼ constant hunt for souls as a short-sighted waste of potential, and demonsʼ chaotic destruction of society and flesh as uncivilized and obnoxious, but they do not loathe their fiendish counterparts. Indeed, most devils are more than willing to take advantage of daemons and demons as they can to further their own machinations.
Stinking, sulfurous hellfire is infused with evil. Hellfire always deals a combination of fire damage and evil damage, though the specific ratio depends on the hellfire's origin. Certain types of hellfire can impose other effects on creatures as well, such as sapping their strength or memories.
While travel to and from Hell is possible with plane shift, another way to reach and traverse the infernal realms is via hellmouths, strange living portals connecting different layers or even different planes. A hellmouth takes the form of a grimacing face, distended maw, or other distressingly organic aperture, and no two share the same appearance. Most are carefully guarded, but some new or well-hidden hellmouths have yet to be discovered.
The devils presented on these pages are a small sampling of the torments Hell has to offer. Other devils, like the inquisition-focused bone devils, the cherub-faced and fly-bodied accuser devils, and the aquatic drowning devil are a few examples of these widespread immortal creatures.
The four queens of the night wield great power in the Pit. Ardad Lili is a plotter and manipulator with ambitions of ruling the heavens, while Doloras revels in suffering. Most distant is Mahathallah, watching over fate and death. Mightiest among them is Eiseth, who is assembling an army in Dis in the hopes of claiming the iron throne of Malebolge.
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little use for compassion or empathy. As such, it exists entirely within a strict hierarchy, and this order extends to its denizens. While different types of demons correspond to various sins and daemons are associated with modes of mortal death, the different types of devils exist solely to fulfill particular roles in the infernal machine. On occasion, a particular devil can transcend the role for which they were literally shaped, but this often transforms the devil physically into the type suitable for their new role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Otyugh.
Lords of sewers, ditches, and landfllls, otyughs are lthy monstrosities that stomp about on three massive legs in search of tasty garbage and refuse. Using two barbed tentacles to grasp and tear, guided by a third with a proliferation of eyes at the end, the otyugh has perfectly adapted to life in its cramped, disgusting environment, where it uses its appendages to see into tight spaces and grasp hidden prey.
Most assume that otyughs originally evolved in swamps and moved into sewers as civilization encroached on their natural habitats. True or not, they are now one of the larger predators in those dank environs. Otyughs are territorial, but they have been known to form loose collectives, even giving each other important-sounding titles like “king of offal” and “duchess of slime” to indicate their rank and station in their sludgy underworld beneath the streets.
Those who run across an otyugh might be surprised to hear it speak, shouting at intruders to leave its putrid home or demanding tribute in the form of trash or other prizes of dubious nature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Owlbear.
With the body of a powerful brown bear and the keen senses of an owl, the owlbear is a dangerous territorial predator, fearlessly attacking any creature that strays into its domain. Those who run afoul of an owlbear hear its terrifying screech only seconds before the massive creature is upon them, ripping them apart with deadly talons and a powerful beak.
Although their origin is lost to time, owlbears are assumed to be the result of a magical experiment to make a more cunning predator. According to the legend, the wizard was too successful and ended up being the flrst victim of the beast. Today, owlbears can be found around the world, with a variety of features. While the most common subspecies looks like a brown bear with the features of a great horned owl, owlbears from the frozen north might resemble polar bears mixed with snowy owls, and in temperate rain forests they might resemble black bears with the heads of barn owls.
Most owlbears live solitary lives, gathering only to mate and raise cubs, which are hatched from eggs. An owlbear’s territory usually extends to around 5 miles from its lair, with clear signs of its habitat appearing with 1 mile (clawed up trees, gigantic feathers, and shredded carcasses). The lair of an owlbear rarely holds anything of value, but some adventurers have found trinkets, coins, and even jewelry in the massive pellets of undigested bones these monsters leave behind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Pachycephalosaurus.
Pachycephalosauruses are normally peaceful herbivorous dinosaurs, but they grow much more violent during their mating season, when they fight one another to win over mates and warn away interlopers. They also defend themselves vehemently when potential predators stray too close to their herd. The pachycephalosaurus's skull has a distinctive dome-shaped crown surrounded by numerous blunt, bony horns. This feature, combined with the dinosaur's powerful, compact neck, allows it to make battering-ram-like charges capable of inflicting great damage.
Some humanoid groups have successfully trained pachycephalosauruses for use as mounts, but the creatures aren't particularly well suited to the task.
Pachycephalosauruses grow to a length of 15 feet and weigh 1,400 pounds.
While the real world fossil records hold a wealth of inspiration for the reconstruction of dinosaurs in an RPG, you can also look to living creatures for ideas. Giving a dinosaur a poisonous bite or an unusual attack routine like Clobbering Charge ensures that dinosaurs are as interesting in combat as they are in appearance.
As with most animals, dinosaurs can be tamed or domesticated, but the difficulty of this task increases along with the dinosaur’s level. Lizardfolk and orcs are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, workhorses, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In certain cities, dinosaurs are popularly featured as combatants in blood sports and other gladiatorial battles.
As animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear. Dinosaurs can also be harvested for rare and valuable trophies such as teeth, talons, armor plates, and the like.
At first glance, the inclusion of dinosaurs in a fantasy setting might seem strange, but dinosaurs are an excellent creature to use in a game that bridges the gap between familiar real-world animals and legendary monsters. If having dinosaurs mix freely with lions, manticores, and dragons still seems strange to you, consider having them dwell in remote, primeval lands, as suggested in the sidebars on pages 99–100. On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in the wilder regions of the world, particularly on the continent of Garund, though they are common enough that PCs might find some on display in a menagerie in a northern city, in use as guardian creatures, or even kept by druids as loyal animal companions.
Another classic place that dinosaurs are found in fiction are in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal place to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day‑night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam.
In a fantasy setting, magical effects or supernatural influences can enhance dinosaurs by giving them unexpected attacks, modes of movement, or other abilities. You can quickly create a memorable magical beast simply by giving a dinosaur the magical attack of another creature of an equal level, such as a spinosaurus gaining an acidic breath weapon akin to that of an adult black dragon.
A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or a quick online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well. Armor-headed pachycephalosaurs, spike-thumbed iguanodons, duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed spinosauruses, and more await discovery by those who would seek out the mysteries of the lost worlds where the thunder lizards still rule!
Dinosaurs fit well into certain types of settings. They’re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Pegasus.
The pegasus is a winged horse prized for its capacity to serve as an aerial mount. Unfortunately for those who desire a saddle-trained pegasus, pegasi are wild creatures and do not readily accept even well-intentioned riders. Pegasi actively resist being mounted or controlled by evil creatures, attempting to buck an unwanted rider at every opportunity. A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet.
Pegasi are highly intelligent beasts and have a strong sense of pride and honor. The best way to entreat a pegasus is by speaking to it with grace and offering gifts appropriate to a creature of such majesty. Prospective riders who seek the mount for a worthy cause or virtuous quest have a much easier time coaxing a pegasus into granting its favor. Regardless, a pegasus never accepts a bit or saddle, for reasons both practical (a standard horse saddle interferes with its wings) and purely egotistical.
In the wild, pegasi live in small herds and establish territories on remote mountains where they are relatively safe from hunters and slavers. They mature at the same rate as horses and can even breed with other equines, though the outcome of such unions is typically a foal with the traits of its least magical parent. On rare occasions, the interbreeding of a pegasus and a unicorn may result in a winged unicorn with characteristics of both parents and an unrivaled sense of righteousness.
Some pegasi carry in them the blood of a mighty and heroic ancestor. These champions of pegasus-kind dedicate their long lives to the pursuit of justice. They possess powerful supernatural abilities to aid them in this fight, such as resistance to fire and poison, immunity to petrification, and holy hoof attacks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Peluda.
Peludas are wild and savage dragons that favor reedy marshlands, sparsely forested bogs, and river valleys for lairs. A single peluda typically claims a stretch of waterways a few miles in length, then systematically drives off any potential rivals so that the peluda can despoil the land as they please, leaving clawed footprints on muddy riverbanks, toppling trees, and impaling half-eaten corpses on their quills as trophies left to rot. They venture beyond their domains to hunt, roasting prey with their breath or pulverizing them with their tails, burning and killing for cruel sport before slithering, sated, back to their mucky lairs.
Peludas despise weakness and loathe creatures smaller than themselves, especially humanoids, whom they see as fragile and soft, good only for eating or breaking. In contrast, peludas have a massive inferiority complex regarding more impressive creatures—especially larger and stronger dragons. Peludas will try anything to become stronger, including ingesting shiny coins, gems, and jewelry, which old folk tales claim will strengthen their quills and fire breath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Peryton.
The peryton is an amalgam of horror, merging the features of a stag, wolf, and hawk. They love using shadows to stalk their victims before ripping out their still-beating hearts and relishing the dying pulse as they swallow them whole, so the doomed victims spends their last moments watching as their flesh is consumed.
Despite perytons' animalistic appearance and brutal behavior, they are viciously cunning and as intelligent as humans. Their preferred tactic is to find a lone traveler and stalk it from on high. Most perytons are loners who loathe all other creatures. These feelings extend to other perytons as well, and adult males attack each other on sight as surely as they attack anything else.
Once per year, perytons mate. The males offer up hearts they have collected from humanoids to attract females. Those that manage to secure a mate rarely survive long though, as their mating ritual is short and violent. Female perytons generally abandon their eggs after laying them, so newly hatched perytons must fend for themselves from the moment they emerge.
A lone peryton typically builds a nest in a rocky overhang or an exceptionally tall and strong tree where they can observe nearby lands. Although they aren't particularly interested in wealth, perytons do like to collect small objects from their victims. During those times between hunts, they sometimes study these trophies in order to relive the memories of victims' last moments and the taste of victims' hearts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Petitioner.
When a mortal dies, their soul travels to the Boneyard in the Outer Planes where they are judged by Pharasma, the goddess of the dead. Once they have been judged, their soul is sent on to their final reward or punishment in the afterlife, and in the process is transformed into a creature known as a petitioner. This process grants the soul a new body, one whose shape is the result of the prevailing philosophical forces of the plane to which it is sent. The petitioner's memories from their life are typically wiped nearly clean, allowing them to retain only a few hazy fragments akin to half-remembered dreams. Regardless of the petitioner's size, power, or nature in life, they're a Medium creature in their afterlife.
Existence as a petitioner can last for eons, but this state is not necessarily eternal. Deities, powerful denizens of the Great Beyond, or even the outer planes themselves can further change the petitioner's nature by transforming them into raw quintessence, spiritual essence that is then used to expand a plane's physical manifestation, or by transforming the petitioner into a new form of supernatural life such as a celestial, monitor, or fiend. Should a petitioner die, their body breaks down in a process akin to decay, their nature reverting back to the quintessence or elements that make up their plane. This represents the true end of a soul's journey: their associated life essence travels back to the heart of the Great Beyond to be recycled into the Positive Energy plane, fueling the creation of entirely new souls.A soul sent to the First World does not become a petitioner. Rather, they immediately reincarnate into a fey creature whose temperament and role match their mortal personalities. This process tends to leave souls who incarnate into the First World with slightly more fragments of memories than most petitioners, yet still not enough that they remember who they once were.
Each plane (save the Negative Energy Plane) has its own category of petitioner, but not every plane or demiplane present in the Pathfinder setting is listed here. Certainly, planes of your own design aren't represented! You can use the wide range of petitioner types and descriptions here as templates or inspiration for creating new types of petitioners: each needs a name, appearance, alignment, language, additional ability, and attack. For instance, Desna maintains a demiplane called Cynosure that straddles the Material Plane and Elysium. Petitioners on Cynosure are known as the chosen dreamers, and they appear as idealized and softly glowing versions of their mortal selves; they are chaotic good, speak Celestial, are immune to confusion and stupefied, and deal bludgeoning damage with their fists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Phistophilus (Contract Devil).
Contract devils are clerks, scribes, and bureaucrats of Hell rarely found outside the infernal courts, and then almost always to pursue potential contracts, tempting mortals to sell their souls in exchange for achieving their worldly desires. If a target is desirable enough, a phistophilus can offer contracts for prices seemingly lesser than their soul all at once, though in this case, the devil carefully manipulates the price to drive the signatory toward the forces of law and evil, and therefore ultimately to Hell anyway. Contract devils are tall creatures with skin tones that range from bronze to crimson and large curving horns extending from their bodies, over which they often drape favored or important contracts.
At any one time, eight archdevils rule the eight upper layers of Hell, while the deepest layer is ruled by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a unique demigod with a dedicated role in guiding the infernal machine forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Phoenix.
The phoenix is a primordial bird made of heat and flame that dwells in the most inhospitable regions of the desert. Though highly intelligent and brimming with compassion, the phoenix is best-known for its iconic ability to resurrect itself when slain, emerging reborn from the ashes of its own corpse. Phoenixes are often sought out for their knowledge or healing abilities, as they cannot abide the sight of suffering and deny their succor only to the most foul and irredeemable of creatures.
Phoenixes enjoy the company of metallic dragons, and when the two dwell in close proximity, they can forge lifelong friendships, sharing their resources and words of wisdom while keeping each other updated on regional news.
While most phoenixes are benevolent, they are not infallible. When a phoenix loses its way or falls under the influence of evil, it still retains its strong appetite for knowledge. Evil phoenixes are known to assault universities and libraries in their pursuit for power—not only to gain new information, but also to set fire to the texts and thus hoard that knowledge for themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Piscodaemon (Venom Daemon).
Scions of death by poisoning, piscodaemons are cruel even by daemonic standards, delighting in slow and painful suffering. To a piscodaemon, death is but the icing on a putrescent cake—its true pleasure comes from watching, hearing, smelling, and even tasting raw anguish. While poisons and venoms are piscodaemons' preferred tools, their cruel claws are more than capable of tearing enemies asunder if necessary.
Piscodaemons dwell in fetid swamps and noxious waterways, including the River Styx, the Bile Sluice, and the Drowning Court of Charon, Horseman of Death. They are often accompanied by cadres of hydrodaemons—representations of death by drowning. While they are cunning commanders, piscodaemons are apt to forget their station in the heat of battle and slice their way to the center of the fray.
While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals’ fear.
While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane of pure evil for only the most corrupt souls. If Hell is a realm of torture and systematic depravity, Abaddon is its twisted cousin—a place where one can find only misery and despair in ample quantities, with neither the strictures of Hell nor the chaotic freedom of the Abyss. For evildoers who seek simply to inflict their wickedness on others, Abaddon is a rich hunting ground where one can revel in turpitude, though visitors be forewarned: the competition is fierce.
The four Horsemen are the most powerful of the daemonic demigods, but they are only four of many. Far more daemonic harbingers dwell on Abaddon, each a unique and powerful demigod in their own right that enjoys sweeping influence among daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector (ruler of the slave city of Awaiting Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian (consort to the Horseman of Famine), and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame (patron to arsonists and agent of the Horseman of War) are but three of the dozens of harbingers who rule realms in Abaddon.
Each of the four Horsemen is served by a specific category of servitor daemons known as deacons. Leukodaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Pestilence. Meladaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Famine, while thanadaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Death. Purrodaemons are currently the most powerful of the deacons, and serve the Horseman of War—yet over time, which category of deacon is the most powerful can wax and wane.
Numerous powerful and unique daemon demigods, known collectively as harbingers, rule over swaths of Abaddon. Above these demigods, though, are entities of even greater power—the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. As the eons go on, the names and identities of specific horsemen change. Currently, they consist of Apollyon (Horseman of Pestilence), Charon (Horseman of Death), Szuriel (Horseman of War), and Trelmarixian (Horseman of Famine). Of these, only Charon has never fallen to an upstart. Some hold that a “Fifth Horseman” once ruled over the other four, while others maintain that the eternally eclipsed sun in the skies above Abaddon is all that remains of this long-dead god.
As many daemons exist as there are awful ways to die. The bloody sangudaemon personifies death by blood loss, while the skeletal thanadaemon represents death from old age. The most powerful daemons are the olethrodaemons, who represent the massive deaths caused by apocalypses and the end of entire worlds.
Daemons often carry soul gems either as trophies or for powering an ability. Cacodaemons are the most common source for soul gems, but they can also be created by spells like bind soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem to power an ability, the trapped soul is released into the afterlife and can be resurrected normally.
Soul gems are traded in illicit markets, a tradition celestials and psychopomps alike find vile. Soul gems' value varies, but is generally worth an amount relative to the level of a gem's captive soul.
Daemons embody a fundamental paradox—while they are incarnations of death and seek to devour all that lives, they are themselves living creatures. Some speak of a glorious end time after which reality will finally be free of the contagion that is life itself. Most daemons give no thought to this paradox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Pit Fiend (Tyrant Devil).
When an army of devils invades to bathe a region in bloodshed and hellfire, it is likely that one of Hell’s most powerful and diabolical generals, the pit fiend, masterminded the incursion. Cunning, powerful, and ruthless, pit fiends often serve the archdevils directly. They rule infernal duchies, subjugate mortal worlds, and usurp infernal rivals using unparalleled despotism and calculated ferocity. To realize their tyrannical machinations, pit fiends claim mortal souls that they corrupt into lemure servants, which can then be shaped and transformed through infernal manipulation into the terrifying devils that form Hell’s formidable legions. They often select the most wicked and vicious lemures for their armies, drawing upon these lesser devils’ depravity during powerful magical ceremonies to create hideous and terrifying abominations that can cow and eviscerate the pit fiend’s enemies.
Pit fiends themselves are crafted deep within the nightmarish bowels of Nessus, the ninth layer of Hell, to serve the whims of archdevils and infernal dukes. Those pit fiends that don’t leave Nessus to command infernal legions in the upper layers of Hell often form the courts of Hell’s elite, gathering cabals and sects that shape Hell’s political landscape through subterfuge and manipulation. But many pit fiends see themselves as living embodiments of hellfire, the all-encompassing wrath of Hell, and thus prefer to dwell in realms consumed by fire. In Avernus, Dis, Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon, pit fiends build vast citadels of brimstone wreathed in flame to lord over.
Pit fiends tower over other devils, standing at least 16 feet tall, weighing over 1,000 pounds, and brandishing wingspans in excess of 20 feet. Infernal Dukes Elite members of Hell’s political infrastructure and leadership hierarchy, the dukes of Hell are chosen from among the most tyrannical, oppressive, and conniving devils. While not all infernal dukes are pit fiends, a pit fiend’s natural disposition toward conquest and oppression often make it an ideal candidate for this position. To create an infernal duke, adjust the pit fiend to be between 21st and 25th level. Because of their physical prowess, manipulative nature, and powerful spellcasting abilities, infernal dukes make excellent villains for long-running campaigns.
At any one time, eight archdevils rule the eight upper layers of Hell, while the deepest layer is ruled by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a unique demigod with a dedicated role in guiding the infernal machine forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city. Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries, and Belial designs new weapons for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the oldest archdevil and keeper of many secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs armies. Baalzebul is a brooding archdevil who has fallen from Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty Mephistopheles was formed from the plane of Hell itself.
Many unique and powerful devils hold positions of power in Hell. The most numerous of these are the infernal dukes, many of whom were promoted to this position from already impressive statures as pit fiends. The supreme ruler of Hell itself is Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness. Between these two tiers rule the eight archdevils—see the sidebar on the facing page.
The nine layers of Hell are the planar home of all devils, and they much prefer its tyrannically ordered environs to anywhere else in the multiverse. Yet devils can be encountered anywhere mortals can be tempted by infernal bargains or seek diabolic aid. On Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is particularly aligned with Hell. Its government is based upon Hellʼs organization, and the state church is that of Asmodeus.
Devils view daemonsʼ constant hunt for souls as a short-sighted waste of potential, and demonsʼ chaotic destruction of society and flesh as uncivilized and obnoxious, but they do not loathe their fiendish counterparts. Indeed, most devils are more than willing to take advantage of daemons and demons as they can to further their own machinations.
Stinking, sulfurous hellfire is infused with evil. Hellfire always deals a combination of fire damage and evil damage, though the specific ratio depends on the hellfire's origin. Certain types of hellfire can impose other effects on creatures as well, such as sapping their strength or memories.
While travel to and from Hell is possible with plane shift, another way to reach and traverse the infernal realms is via hellmouths, strange living portals connecting different layers or even different planes. A hellmouth takes the form of a grimacing face, distended maw, or other distressingly organic aperture, and no two share the same appearance. Most are carefully guarded, but some new or well-hidden hellmouths have yet to be discovered.
The devils presented on these pages are a small sampling of the torments Hell has to offer. Other devils, like the inquisition-focused bone devils, the cherub-faced and fly-bodied accuser devils, and the aquatic drowning devil are a few examples of these widespread immortal creatures.
The four queens of the night wield great power in the Pit. Ardad Lili is a plotter and manipulator with ambitions of ruling the heavens, while Doloras revels in suffering. Most distant is Mahathallah, watching over fate and death. Mightiest among them is Eiseth, who is assembling an army in Dis in the hopes of claiming the iron throne of Malebolge.
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little use for compassion or empathy. As such, it exists entirely within a strict hierarchy, and this order extends to its denizens. While different types of demons correspond to various sins and daemons are associated with modes of mortal death, the different types of devils exist solely to fulfill particular roles in the infernal machine. On occasion, a particular devil can transcend the role for which they were literally shaped, but this often transforms the devil physically into the type suitable for their new role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Pixie.
Insatiably curious, overly excitable, and just a bit puckish, pixies are wanderers and tricksters who use their pixie dust to create all sorts of whimsical situations, as well as to defend themselves. Other creatures often have trouble understanding a pixie’s rapid, rambling way of speaking.
Sprite pranks tend to be kind‑hearted in nature; they might use their abilities to embarrass a braggart or to trick them into a convoluted scheme to help someone notice an admirer who has been there for them all along. Their plans are often half-baked; sprites’ mercurial nature means they can easily become distracted by something new before following through on a previous plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Plague Zombie.
Plague zombies are infested with hideous contagions.
You can modify zombies with the following zombie abilities. Most zombies have one of these abilities; If you give a zombie more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics.
Disgusting Pustules (disease, necromancy) The zombie is covered in pustules that rupture when it takes any piercing damage or any critical hit. In either case, adjacent creatures are hit with vile fluid, causing them to become sickened 1 unless they succeed at a Fortitude save.
Feast (manipulate) If the zombie is adjacent to a helpless or unconscious creature, or a deceased creature that died in the past hour, the zombie can feast upon its flesh to heal itself. This restores an amount of Hit Points equal to the zombie’s level. If the creature is alive, the zombie deals damage equal to its jaws, flst, or claw damage.
Plague-Ridden (disease, necromancy) The zombie carries a plague that can create more of its own kind. This functions as the plague zombie’s zombie rot, except at stage 5, the victim rises as another of the zombie’s type, rather than a plague zombie.
Rotting Aura (aura, disease, necromancy) The zombie emits an aura of rot and disease that causes wounds to fester and turn sour. Any living creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie and is not at full Hit Points takes 1d6 damage as its wounds fester. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 6 levels the zombie has. Creatures that take a critical hit from the zombie also take this damage immediately.
Unkillable This zombie is nigh unkillable. The zombie loses its weakness to slashing and gains resistance against all damage equal to its level (minimum 3), and it gains weakness equal to twice its level (minimum 6) to critical hits. Increase the zombie’s level by 1 if you give it this ability.
To create a zombie creature, start with a zombie of the appropriate size. Then add any Strikes, Speeds, or other abilities it would gain from its shape. To create a Gargantuan zombie, begin with the zombie hulk, apply the elite adjustments, change its size to Gargantuan, and increase its reach by 5 feet.
Zombies are often created using unwholesome necromantic rituals. Among the living dead, zombies are most often used as fodder, wearing down defenses and consuming resources before more powerful undead arrive to deal the killing blow. Zombies cannot speak or really even think for themselves, but they can be commanded by other allied undead and powerful necromancers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Planetar (Justice Angel).
The beings of righteous fury known as planetars are known to be the least patient of angels. They exist to destroy evil that cannot be redeemed, and they often leave prolonged dialogue to other angels. Of course, no planetar ignores the importance of diplomacy, but they know that others among the angelic hosts are better suited to that task, while they focus on the larger picture. In angelic armies, planetars serve as commanders or generals. They stand at least 9 feet tall and weigh over 500 pounds.
The most powerful angels belong to a category of demigods known as the empyreal lords—a title shared with other powerful good-aligned demigods among the host of archons, azatas, and other inhabitants of the celestial planes. The most powerful and most well-known of the angelic empyreal lords is Sarenrae.
Angels normally live on Nirvana or other celestial planes, but their missions can bring them to the Material Plane. Spellcasters can conjure them for aid or advice in times of need, and they can even be found, if rarely, crusading against fiends in Hell, the Abyss, or anywhere in between.
Many angels wear exquisite armor or wield beautiful and often magical weapons. While they are not hampered by mortal sins like greed or pride (save for the very rare and tragic exception), they do enjoy the beauty of fine clothing, exquisite jewelry, and works of art.
The most powerful angels are known as the solars, but numerous others can be found in Nirvana working their own missions or goals. Angels generally appear as beautiful, often somewhat androgynous humanoids, and the most powerful often possess two or even four sets of feathered wings.
Three types of devas exist among the angelic host, all of which serve as angelic “field agents.” Of the types of angels, devas are the ones most likely to be encountered dwelling somewhere other than Nirvana, as these angels focus their work on cultivating and protecting goodness in mortal souls, be they living or dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Pleroma.
Among the most powerful of all the true aeons, pleromas are a manifestation of the duality of creation and destruction. Their physical manifestation is a constant state of flux between these two poles, their forms a shifting cloak of black where galaxies and other celestial objects flit in and out of existence, as if depicting the constant life, death, and rebirth of a miniature, self-contained universe.
Pleromas see the multiverse as both eternal and cyclical, doomed and malleable, ending only if these cycles ever become unbalanced. They believe the current Convergence is necessary to obtain this essential balance, and act to ensure that the grand design of the Monad is carried out to the smallest detail.
As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons’ war against imbalance—particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos.
Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the “Convergence.” At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons — but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How—or if—this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves.
Whether the aeons serve an actual divinity, a philosophical concept, or merely a “supreme oneness” is a topic hotly debated by planar scholars. The aeons themselves are silent, referring to this being or concept as the Monad, a “condition of all.” Regardless of what the Monad actually is, there certainly exists another category of powerful aeons—the primal inevitables, each a unique demigod with its own powers and goals. Relatively few primal inevitables remain today, for nearly three-quarters of their irreplaceable kind have fallen in the endless battle with the inexorable forces of entropy.
Aeons are among the least understood of the Great Beyond’s immortal creatures, and they have a wide range of powers and abilities. Far more aeons exist than those presented here, including guardians of time like the four-armed bythos and the weirdly symmetrical theletos, which moderates the duality between freedom and fate.
To mortals, aeons sometimes seem to combine elements that are fundamentally incompatible, whether it's an aeon combining opposing concepts, or axiomites and inevitables mixing the organic with the mathematical or mechanical. Aeons see no paradox in this, but rather claim it is an expression of the underlying unity of all things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Polar Bear.
Polar bears are known for their pale fur, with black eyes, lips, and toe pads. They are aggressively predatory creatures, stalking prey for miles on land or across the icy waters of frozen oceans. They are also amazing ambush predators, leaping from the water to ambush seals resting on ice floes. If they are desperate, polar bears hunt not only other animals but also humanoids.
A bear den can contain valuable treasures, such as the remains of less fortunate adventurers who stumbled into a hungry bear’s path. Bear furs themselves are valued as rugs, while their claws and fangs make for impressive jewelry or adornments for armor. Bear hide is an excellent resource for hide armor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Poltergeist.
When a creature dies, and for whatever reason its spirit is unable or unwilling to leave the site of its death, that spirit may manifest as a poltergeist: a restless invisible spirit that is still able to manipulate physical objects. Many poltergeists perished in a way that resulted from or has led to extreme emotional trauma.
A poltergeist needs items to hurl as weapons, and over the centuries of use, only durable objects survive its rampages. Silver dinnerware, hatchets, and books might all be found in a poltergeist’s collection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Poracha.
Porachas are feline beasts native to the mystical Forest of Spirits in Tian Xia. In their natural form, these graceful eight-legged creatures sport a gray tabby coat of fur streaked with lines of olive green, but they are rarely seen this way. Even the youngest porachas are capable of hiding within objects, making them incredibly elusive and rarely seen except on their own terms. Because porachas can so effortlessly blend in with the forest and emerge from its dark corners in an instant, superstitious locals believe these beasts are related to kami—nature spirits who embody individual trees, stones, or other elements of nature in the Forest of Spirits. The truth is that while porachas frequently associate with kami, they are their own breed of mysterious monster with powers over time and space that set them apart from nature spirits.
The poracha’s most iconic feature is its ability to bend reality to teleport, or jaunt, short distances. But a poracha can also rest within objects, allowing it to safely sleep inside. Given that a poracha experiences time very slowly while hiding within objects, it can sleep inside of one for an extended period. Once it wakes, a poracha departs to play in the living world. Porachas especially enjoy resting inside roadside milestones, to maximize their chances of coming across travelers.
Porachas rarely tread humanoid-occupied lands, preferring the company of the kami and their natural habitat in the Forest of Spirits. Though they enjoy occasional conversation, they’re extremely sensitive to sound; they speak softly and request the same from those they speak with. Their territories span vast swaths of the wood, making them ideal allies for hunters or treasure seekers who would otherwise become lost in the dense trees. But porachas are nothing if not flckle, and typically demand inscrutable favors in return for their aid, such as the planting of a rare sapling in a particular grotto or the clearing of an invasive monster species around a treasured spring. Any attempt to coerce or trick a poracha into service is ill advised, for these sacred beasts have many friends among the kami as well as others of their kind. Though they generally don’t travel in groups, porachas know where to find more of their kind in times of need, and an organized pack of porachas is a disorienting threat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Precentor.
Velstrac storytellers and historians are known as precentors. Trailed by horrific choirs, precentors perform in the courts of the velstrac demagogues.
Velstracs manifest from the souls of masochistic or sadistic mortals that are diverted into the Shadow Plane and then forged into forms that suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the aesthetics-obsessed interlocutors.
Some mortals refer to velstracs as “kytons,” a misattribution that the velstracs tolerate with cold amusement. The term “kyton” denotes a master or virtuoso among their kind, and these fiends enjoy being labeled masters of their horrid paths to perfection through agony.

Velstracs originated with the first debased thoughts of mortals, which the gods found so deplorable that they locked all velstracs away in Hell. It wasn’t long, however, before the newly formed race of velstracs escaped their infernal prison to the Shadow Plane.
Velstracs originated with the first debased thoughts of mortals, which divine beings found so deplorable that they locked all velstracs away in Hell. It wasn't long, however, before the newly formed beings escaped their infernal prison to the Shadow Plane.
Scholars grimly joke that there are as many different kinds of velstracs as there are ways to skin a cat. The relatively diminutive cantor velstrac poisons the minds of its victims so that they believe they are being clawed from the inside out. The mighty eremites, on the other hand, seek out the most powerful beings to subsume into their own form and lord over all other velstracs save the demagogues.
There are as many different velstracs as there are ways to inflict pain. Other velstracs range in power from the relatively weak lampadariuses to the powerful phylacators.
Many velstracs outsource the forging of their chains to unique velstracs known as almoners. These six-armed, legless humanoids toil endlessly at a great burning foundry called the Shadow Forge. Almoners operate under mysterious strictures, and are just as likely to turn a velstrac away empty-handed as not.
Many velstracs forge their own chains, but others outsource the task to unique velstracs known as almoners. These blind, deaf, and mute velstracs resemble six-armed halflings severed at the waist that toil away endlessly at a great burning foundry called the Shadow Forge. Almoners operate under mysterious strictures, and are just as likely to turn a velstrac away empty-handed as they are to hand one a finely crafted chain before the request has even been uttered.
The most powerful velstracs are unique divinities known collectively as demagogues—powerful creatures often worshipped by mortals who seek to experience agonizing new revelations and gain power by enhancing the body through pain.

Velstracs are most often encountered in the shadowy realm of Nidal, where the state worship of Zon-Kuthon is rigidly enforced. Indeed, many velstracs are created from the souls of Joyful Things, devotees of Zon-Kuthon who have had their limbs amputated to focus their minds on the veneration of pain, sacrifice, and torment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Pteranodon.
Pteranodons are quick and agile reptiles with 20-foot wingspans that enable them to hover on wind currents for hours. These creatures have long beaks and equally long crests that protrude from the backs of their heads.
These flying reptiles can be found in a wide selection of regions, but they tend to soar above warm or temperate climates.
Although not true dinosaurs, pterosaurs are often found in the same regions as dinosaurs and other megafauna, wheeling in the skies above and adding to the general primeval ambiance of these lost worlds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Pugwampi.
Mean, dog-faced, and craven, pugwampis take disproportionate enjoyment from the accidents and missteps of other creatures—something that happens often due to the supernatural aura of ill fortune these gremlins project. They enjoy preparing pranks involving spikes, excrement, pits full of spiders, and the like. Pugwampis are somewhat deaf and thus often yell loudly to each other when not hiding. Many pugwampis worship gnolls as gods and aspire to be more like gnolls, although gnolls hate pugwampis even more than most creatures do, due to their sycophantic fawning.
All gremlins are hoarders, and their nests are cluttered with objects both valuable and worthless. Sorting through a gremlin nest can reveal unexpected treasures like pieces of jewelry or minor magic items, but care must also be taken to avoid being cut on rusty shards of metal, picking up cursed items, or disturbing a hidden nest of venomous vermin.
Superstitious societies sometimes hang tiny bells made of semiprecious metals in the belief that such bells will dissuade gremlins from destroying an affixed object or infesting a home. Strangely enough, most gremlins believe this superstition as well, and even when a gremlin bell hasn’t been magically enhanced, a gremlin usually won’t risk tinkering with objects that seem to be protected in such a manner.
Lawful evil gremlins are sometimes drawn to the worship of archdevils, though not in an orthodox fashion. Dispater is revered as the archdevil of cities—playgrounds to engage in thievery and sabotage. Mammon is worshipped as the bringer of wealth and protector of gremlin warrens that, like his domain of Erebus, are dark and trap-filled. Neutral evil gremlins have been known to worship Norgorber in his aspect as a patron of thieves, but pugwampis in particular prefer to worship gnolls (or at least, worship whoever the local gnolls worship). Chaotic evil gremlins often revere Andirifkhu, demon lord of illusions, knives, and traps. Those that retain a connection to the First World may swear allegiance to the Lantern King, Eldest of laughter, mischief, and transmutation.
Most know better than to employ gremlins, so when the fey creatures live side-by-side with others, it's often as parasites and unwelcome guests. Imaginative and sinister folk who find themselves infested sometimes catch the gremlins and release them in the homes of their enemies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Purple Worm.
The purple worm is the most common and infamous of the cave worms, a much-feared monster wandering the twisting tunnels of the Darklands that is capable of carving out entire cave systems. Tunnels bored by a purple worm don’t always last long after these creature’s passage, and areas where they nest are maddening mazes of passageways that lead nowhere, yet navigating the labyrinth to find the worm’s central nest often yields amazing treasures left behind by the worm’s prior victims.
The adventure need not end simply because the party was ingloriously swallowed whole by a giant cave worm. Perhaps the PCs find an undigested item that helps them survive the inhospitable environ, or maybe the worm regurgitates them in a cavern far off from where they started. Whatever the specifics, you can easily draw from folklore and popular fiction to create your own "belly of the worm" adventure for heroes who wind up on the wrong side of the monster’s scales.
Cave worms are notoriously dim witted, driven primarily by purely animalistic needs to feed and reproduce. This hasn’t prevented attempts to use them as guardians for their lairs, if not to tame them. Magic can be used to maintain control over a worm, but gifted, patient, and brave animal trainers can condition cave worms to serve in all manner of roles, such as living siege engines, shocking methods of executing foes, or merely pets.
Some societies view the immense cave worms as natural disasters or incarnations of wrathful gods. Cave worms that have been active in a region often become part of that area’s local lore. For example, in the notorious Cinderlands of eastern Varisia, Shoanti have long told tales of Cindermaw, an immense crimson worm viewed by some as worthy of worship, and by others as the ultimate test of bravery.
Cave worms are infamous for being nearly unstoppable and for swallowing their prey whole. A cave worm also ingests earth and minerals as it tunnels. The worm processes some of these minerals, resulting in its armored hide and toxic sting, while it leaves others behind—often including treasure or other valuables that incidentally serve to lure explorers into the worm’s proximity and, more often than not, its gullet. While not completely mindless, cave worms are difficult to train, and most attempts to domesticate them (in theory, a cave worm would make an excellent mining resource) result in disaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Purrodaemon (War Daemon).
Few creatures embody war's sheer amount of bloodshed and loss of life as deeply as the purrodaemons, deacons of war. These giant humanoid daemons are bedecked in black, unholy armor, with weapons piercing their flesh at every opening. Far from wounds, however, these weapons are the purrodaemon's arsenal. A purrodaemon can, with frightening swiftness and nauseating ease, extract a weapon from its own flesh as though drawing a sword from a sheath, and their blood is so tainted with evil that weapons steeped in it become powerful tools of war.
While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals’ fear.
While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane of pure evil for only the most corrupt souls. If Hell is a realm of torture and systematic depravity, Abaddon is its twisted cousin—a place where one can find only misery and despair in ample quantities, with neither the strictures of Hell nor the chaotic freedom of the Abyss. For evildoers who seek simply to inflict their wickedness on others, Abaddon is a rich hunting ground where one can revel in turpitude, though visitors be forewarned: the competition is fierce.
The four Horsemen are the most powerful of the daemonic demigods, but they are only four of many. Far more daemonic harbingers dwell on Abaddon, each a unique and powerful demigod in their own right that enjoys sweeping influence among daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector (ruler of the slave city of Awaiting Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian (consort to the Horseman of Famine), and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame (patron to arsonists and agent of the Horseman of War) are but three of the dozens of harbingers who rule realms in Abaddon.
Each of the four Horsemen is served by a specific category of servitor daemons known as deacons. Leukodaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Pestilence. Meladaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Famine, while thanadaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Death. Purrodaemons are currently the most powerful of the deacons, and serve the Horseman of War—yet over time, which category of deacon is the most powerful can wax and wane.
Numerous powerful and unique daemon demigods, known collectively as harbingers, rule over swaths of Abaddon. Above these demigods, though, are entities of even greater power—the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. As the eons go on, the names and identities of specific horsemen change. Currently, they consist of Apollyon (Horseman of Pestilence), Charon (Horseman of Death), Szuriel (Horseman of War), and Trelmarixian (Horseman of Famine). Of these, only Charon has never fallen to an upstart. Some hold that a “Fifth Horseman” once ruled over the other four, while others maintain that the eternally eclipsed sun in the skies above Abaddon is all that remains of this long-dead god.
As many daemons exist as there are awful ways to die. The bloody sangudaemon personifies death by blood loss, while the skeletal thanadaemon represents death from old age. The most powerful daemons are the olethrodaemons, who represent the massive deaths caused by apocalypses and the end of entire worlds.
Daemons often carry soul gems either as trophies or for powering an ability. Cacodaemons are the most common source for soul gems, but they can also be created by spells like bind soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem to power an ability, the trapped soul is released into the afterlife and can be resurrected normally.
Soul gems are traded in illicit markets, a tradition celestials and psychopomps alike find vile. Soul gems' value varies, but is generally worth an amount relative to the level of a gem's captive soul.
Daemons embody a fundamental paradox—while they are incarnations of death and seek to devour all that lives, they are themselves living creatures. Some speak of a glorious end time after which reality will finally be free of the contagion that is life itself. Most daemons give no thought to this paradox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Quasit.
Unlike other demons, quasits are formed when a mortal spellcaster sheds a portion of their own sinful soul to create a familiar or companion. When these quasits outlive their creators, they become free willed and seek methods of returning to the Abyss, a task that requires pledging servitude to more powerful demons, so many quasits instead opt to remain on the Material Plane to promote evil and hope for chance and luck to someday provide them with a method of reaching the Abyss on their own.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications. For planar ally, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.
The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.
The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.
Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.
When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.
The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.
The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.
While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.
Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Quatoid.
Quatoids are peculiar, mysterious elementals native to the Plane of Water that resemble four-tentacled octopuses with eerily humanoid faces on their mantles.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Though fire and water classically oppose one another, in the right mixture they can become a dangerous combination. Water elementals heated to a scalding temperature through natural factors such as underwater volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent fire damage with their Strikes, while fire elementals infused with moisture might exude clouds of obscuring or even blinding steam.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Quelaunt.
This three-armed, three-legged monster has no discernible eyes, nose, ears, or mouth or no visible means of ingesting food. Its limbs are distributed so evenly across its body that it is all but impossible to tell which way the creature is oriented at any given time. Few who witness the quelaunt linger on its alien looks for long though, as the most pressing concern quickly becomes the invasion of their minds, as the quelaunt sows doubt, sorrow, and rage. This monstrosity not only delights in the negative emotions of its prey, but feeds on them, gaining strength and sustenance from their dismay. For the quelaunt, no act is too terrible or cruel to inflict on its victims, since the more a creature suffers, the more the quelaunt feasts.
Quelaunts are known to associate with other aberrant horrors, including brain collectors and other creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black. However, the more prevalent theory paints them as more alien—perhaps invasive beings from another dimension of pure thought and feeling—and claims that in their natural state they have no physical bodies at all. Few dare speculate further; the only known autopsy of a quelaunt resulted in the researcher’s suicide just days afterward and all the notes were mysteriously destroyed. Whatever secrets there are to be unlocked in the anatomy of these bizarre monsters are apparently important enough to warrant great protection from quelaunts, even after death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Quetzalcoatlus.
Quetzalcoatlus are the largest flying members of the pterosaur family and are often mistaken for dragons due to their immense size and 40-foot wingspans.
Quetzalcoatlus are carnivorous, feeding on a variety of reptiles, mammals, large fish, amphibians, and other invertebrates. They are not inherently aggressive creatures and are happy to scavenge for food, but when presented with live prey they readily attack almost any creature smaller than themselves.
These flying reptiles can be found in a wide selection of regions, but they tend to soar above warm or temperate climates.
Although not true dinosaurs, pterosaurs are often found in the same regions as dinosaurs and other megafauna, wheeling in the skies above and adding to the general primeval ambiance of these lost worlds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Quetz Couatl.
These sacred feathered serpents tirelessly serve the powers of law and good. Some operate directly as messengers and intermediaries of the deities, while others operate independently in aiding the cause of righteousness. Either way, they watch over mortals and try to influence and aid them from the shadows, shifting from plane to plane to spread wisdom and healing where they are needed. Some quetz couatls are worshipped as divinities in remote or isolated societies, and while they do not encourage such veneration, they use the trust placed in them to foster peace and cooperation with others.
Quetz couatls are typically 10 to 20 feet long, with iridescent blue and green scales. Their glorious wings of rainbow-hued feathers span 15 feet and weigh nearly a ton. They are carnivorous, feeding on birds, mammals, and even the occasional evil humanoid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Quickling.
Few creatures can match a quickling's speed. These malicious fey creatures delight in striking with blinding speed and accuracy, racing in to stab and slash at foes before scampering away for cover with maddening— even frightening—swiftness. Stories of people simply doubling over, bleeding from what appear to be spontaneously opening wounds, are often eyewitness accounts of quickling attacks.
Quicklings actively hate the “slow-paced dullards” they encounter every day, delighting in inflicting suffering and pain on creatures they deem too sluggish to matter. While they are related to kinder fey such as brownies and pixies, quicklings care only for their own merriment. They see their own cruel pranks as the height of humor and have full confidence that their speed and invisibility will keep them safe from harm. They occasionally form gangs of up to a dozen individuals, although the group usually devolves very quickly into mayhem, as they inevitably perform increasingly deadly pranks against each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Quoppopak.
Quoppopaks combine the most terrifying aspects of water striders, octopuses, and vampire bats into one evil, water-dwelling monster. Their bodies consist of an oval abdomen, eight hollow tentacles, and a thick, tail-like limb ending in a ventral tube, which resembles a lamprey's mouth and is capable of intaking fluids at an astounding rate. While quoppopaks can clumsily maneuver on land, they prefer to move on water; quoppopaks glide along the surface of lakes or the ocean by thrusting their ventral tubes into the water, cycling liquid up through their bodies, then spraying the water back out in a high-pressure stream through their hollow, spear-like tentacles. Though the ventral tube can't expel fluids, it still poses a substantial threat to other creatures. Quoppopaks have gills, but they are located inside the creatures' abdomens, allowing them to draw their air from the water they siphon through their ventral tubes. Quoppopaks can hold some water in their abdomens for quick forays on land, but this is akin to humans holding their breath to go underwater, and the monsters' water reserves quickly deplete.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Qurashith.
Qurashith—or “gluttonwings” in the Common tongue—are fearsome, bat-like predators that haunt the upper reaches of Gluttondark’s cavern-worlds. These monstrosities are no mere beasts. A qurashith does not simply devour its victims; once it kills its prey, it physically subsumes the creature into its own body, metabolizing the prey’s spiritual essence. Close inspection of a qurashith reveals that its body is an amalgamation of the fiend and its extraplanar and mortal victims, bound together by webs of demonic scar tissue and sticky acidic pus. While the individual personalities of a qurashith’s victims gradually metabolize and diffuse into its very substance over time, a particularly charismatic or magically powerful victim might exert some influence over the qurashith’s mind for a short time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Radiant Warden.
The enigmatic and strange radiant wardens were constructed thousands of years ago to protect observatories and scholars against the incursion of alien aggressors from the Dominion of the Black. Over time, their roles as guardians expanded to include watching over any region where the laws of time and space have worn thin, particularly near portals and permanent gates between planets, planes, or dimensions.
Named for both the radial nature of the concentric rings that make up their bodies as well as the glowing radiance of their attacks, radiant wardens carry on their orders, defending sites from invasion with single-minded purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Raja Rakshasa.
When not disguised as a humanoid, the raja rakshasa has the head of an animal. The hands of a raja rakshasa are more subtly unsettling, for the fingers of these fiends bend outward, away from the palms.
More than any other types of rakshasa, rajas scoff at religion. They understand the power of the divine, yet they view themselves as the only things worthy of worship from mortal creatures; not even their own immortals are deemed deserving of such glorification. Raja rakshasas often form close-knit families that work together to bring down mortal cities or to rule them from the shadows within. Such families of rakshasas often incorporate other breeds of the fiend, often using dandasukas as favored servants or stealthy spies. Even though a raja family works together to achieve a shared goal, infighting and treachery among their own is a constant threat.
Above all rakshasas rule the rakshasa immortals, powerful unique entities who deem themselves deities. These beings include Aksha of the Second Breath, Bundha the Singing Butcher, Dradjit the Godslayer, Kunkarna the Dream Warrior, Mursha the Beastmaster, Otikaya the Spirit Archer, Surpa the Avenger, Zabha the Desecrator, and untold others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ratfolk Grenadier.
Ratfolk grenadiers use alchemy and stealth to defend their communities.
In general, ratfolk have a keen understanding of pathological and alchemical sciences, which they employ in trade and self-defense. They make accomplished alchemists and tinkerers, and they often protect their lairs with traps, bombs, and other creations. Ratfolk merchants regularly dispatch large trade caravans that travel widely for a year or more before returning to their home community. During this time they make an effort to learn new things from the people they encounter and collect new, interesting materials and goods that they can bring back to their warrens.
In their warrens, on the road, and in cities, ratfolk are extremely communal, thriving on proximity to and contact with one another even in relatively tight spaces. In addition, ratfolk are excellent at fighting in cramped spaces alongside their kin. Threatening one ratfolk or their allies is a sure re way to rally the whole community.
On Golarion, ysoki are most numerous in the Darklands below the continent of Tian Xia, where they rule a vast empire, but they can be found in the Inner Sea region as well—particularly in the badlands and hills of Numeria, where they eagerly scavenge and collect strange technological wonders and weapons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Rat Swarm.
A swarm of rats can cause total chaos within a household or business. Contracting filth fever is all the easier when dozens of these agitated or hungry vermin gather to bite victims en masse, making rat-hunting a viable career in many parts of the world as desperate townspeople seek relief from the disease’s spread.
Rats have a reputation of being vicious, aggressive animals that attack food stores in great numbers and spread disease. While rats are immune to the most severe effects of their own filth fever, the disease makes them unpredictable and aggressive. Some populations of rats carry even more deadly diseases, such as bubonic plague.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Raven.
These omnivorous birds are cunning and opportunistic scavengers. Capable of solving simple puzzles in order to retrieve desired items, ravens gather at the periphery of civilization, raiding it as needed when they are not hunting in the wilds. Whether singularly, in pairs, or as a flock, ravens live off scraps as often as they do carrion or prey. They are also unusually social among their own kind, even alerting other ravens to large carcasses with loud, croaking cries; it is rumored that this extends between flocks as well.
Given enough time to develop the relationship and establish what you want, it is possible to engage a raven in a sort of trade. Placing a small, shiny object where the raven can take it might entice it to grab the prize and fly off, returning 3d6 minutes later with something from its own stash. Convincing a raven to trade requires a DC 20 Nature check to Command an Animal and, of course, a raven who has the inclination to trade with you in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ravener.
The ravener presented here was once an ancient red dragon.
A ravener’s flesh is stripped away as part of the transformation, leaving only their skeleton. What they lose in flesh, however, the dragon gains in soul-rending power, as their raw spiritual energy forms a protective barrier around their skeleton, keeping it intact and allowing flight with now-skeletal wings. This new existence is not so easy to maintain as other forms of undeath, however, and the ravener must feed regularly on the souls of living creatures to power their profane metabolism. This hunger is much greater than that of a living dragon, so raveners are forced to relocate regularly, traveling to fresh hunting grounds each time they strip their current home of prey. A ravener may depopulate whole regions at a time in order to sate their endless hunger for souls, lest they lose much of their power and become a ravener husk.
Any evil dragon of at least level 13 can become a ravener, although it is exceedingly rare for a dragon younger than an ancient true dragon (such as a chromatic, primal, or metallic dragon) to do so. Typically, the dragon must perform a rare ritual called ravenous reanimation, but this requirement can be waived if the prospective ravener has the aid of a powerful patron. In certain unique conditions, such as the intervention of a vile god of undeath, a dragon can transform into a ravener after death without the use of this rite at all. A ravener is a powerful creature that is likely to have a major impact on your game, so you might want to create each one as a custom monster. If you don’t have time, you can also create a ravener via the following steps. Increase the dragon’s level by 2 and change their statistics as follows. They gain the undead trait and the Necril language. Increase their AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 2. They gain weakness to good damage and more HP (see below). The ravener’s melee strikes deal an additional 2d6 negative damage, and their damaging Breath Weapon deals an additional 4d6 persistent negative damage.
Starting LevelHP IncreaseWeakness 13-205015 21 or greater9020
A ravener gains the following abilities.
Darkvision
Soulsense A ravener senses the spiritual essence of living and undead creatures within the listed range. Creatures whose material bodies are one unit with their souls, like celestials and fiends, appear brighter to this sense.
Negative Healing
Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious
Cowering Fear (aura, emotion, fear, mental) A ravener’s frightful presence causes creatures to cower in fear as well. As long as a creature is at least frightened 2 or more as a result of the ravener’s frightful presence, it is also immobilized from the fear.
Soul Ward An intangible field of necromantic energy protects a ravener from total destruction. A soul ward has 150 maximum Hit Points, or 200 if the ravener is level 21 or higher. Whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 Hit Point, all damage in excess of what would reduce them to 1 Hit Point is instead dealt to their soul ward. If this damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 Hit Points, the ravener is destroyed. A soul ward’s Hit Points can be restored only via specific ravener abilities such as Consume Soul, ravenous breath, or vicious criticals. A ravener who goes more than a week without successfully using Consume Soul to feed on a dying creature starves, and their soul ward loses 1d4 Hit Points each day until they feed. If the ravener’s soul ward loses all its Hit Points while the ravener still has more than 1 HP, they become a ravener husk.
Consume Soul (death, divine, necromancy) Trigger A living creature within 30 feet of the ravener dies; Effect The ravener tears the creature’s soul from its body with their maw and gulps it down. The dying creature must attempt a DC 44 Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The ravener tears off a small chunk of the creature’s soul. If the victim is restored to life, they are drained 1 in addition to any other side effects of returning to life. The ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to half the creature’s level.
Failure As success, but the creature’s soul is ravaged. The creature is drained 3 and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to the creature’s level.
Critical Failure As failure, but the ravener devours the entire soul. The victim can’t be restored to life as long as the ravener exists except via a 10th-level effect such as miracle or wish, and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to twice the creature’s level.
Discorporate (divine, necromancy) Trigger The ravener takes excess damage to their soul ward but still has at least 51 Hit Points in their soul ward; Effect The ravener draws deeply into their soul ward, discorporating their body into soul energy in order to escape. They take 50 damage to their soul ward and their physical body vanishes, reappearing 1d4 hours later in a random location within 1 mile from the location where they used Discorporate.
Ravenous Breath A ravener’s Breath Weapon is infused with negative energy and strips life essence from the victims. Any creature that fails its save against the ravener’s Breath Weapon is drained 1 (or drained 2 on a critical failure). If at least one creature is drained by the ravener’s Breath Weapon, the ravener’s soul ward gains 5 Hit Points.
Vicious Criticals The ravener treats an attack roll as a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, as long as the attack roll was a success. Additionally, whenever the ravener makes a critical hit with one of their Strikes, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the drained 1 condition. If the target already has a drained value of greater than 0, their drained value instead increases by 1, to a maximum of drained 4. Whenever the ravener applies drain to a creature in this way, their soul ward gains 5 Hit Points.
Cunning and paranoid, raveners prefer to make their lairs in places hostile to mortal life: atop peaks so high that living creatures struggle to breathe the rarefied air, submerged beneath pools of magma in the caldera of an active volcano, and so on. Some raveners even go so far as to deliberately fill their entire lair with lethally poisonous gases, and raveners that are capable of advanced spellcasting often seal their lairs completely, accessing them exclusively by spells such as teleport or gaseous form. Of course, raveners must feed on the living to persist, so they never locate their lairs so far from sources of life that they'll starve.
Raveners view most undead creatures with little more respect than they have for living creatures, but they often make use of them as servants. They prefer incorporeal undead such as ghosts, specters, and wraiths over such crude and simple minions as skeletons and zombies.
While most dragons are too prideful to turn to anyone, even the gods, for help, a few who seek to become raveners are so desperate to stave off death that they might turn to powerful patrons for aid, such as demon lords, evil deities, or powerful necromancers, offering service in exchange for their transformation.
Instead of gaining the vicious criticals ability, a ravener spellcaster gains additional spellcasting prowess. When creating your own ravener spellcaster, give it the spellcasting ability of a spellcaster roughly 2 levels higher than a normal spellcasting dragon of its kind. This typically means that if the original dragon had two spells prepared of its highest level, you should add one more spell of that level and then two spells of the next highest level, while if it had three spells prepared of its highest level, you would add three spells of the next highest level (if applicable, add only a single 10th-level spell). Either way, increase its cantrip level by 1.
If the ravener is unusually young, you might be able to use spells from the relevant spellcasting dragon sidebar, but for a typical ancient dragon, consider the following spells to fill in the new slots, depending on which level of spells you need. 10th wish9th power word kill, telepathic demand, weird8th disappearance, maze, mind blank7th contingency, energy aegis, spell turning
Because they change lairs more often than living dragons, raveners prefer treasure that is compact and easily transported. Instead of sprawling mountains of coins, they tend to prefer precious gems, art objects, and especially magic items, particularly magic items they are capable of using.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Ravener Husk.
Raveners require a steady diet of souls, and a ravener that's unable to feed for too long eventually cannibalizes their own soul. Should a ravener's soul ward ever be reduced to 0 Hit Points by hunger while the ravener has more than 1 Hit Point (see Soul Ward), they lose all traces of their former identity and descend into a feral, nearly mindless state. Even if a ravener husk later consumes soul energy, the transformation can be reversed only via Ravenous Repast.
A ravener’s flesh is stripped away as part of the transformation, leaving only their skeleton. What they lose in flesh, however, the dragon gains in soul-rending power, as their raw spiritual energy forms a protective barrier around their skeleton, keeping it intact and allowing flight with now-skeletal wings.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Ravenile.
Raveniles are rare mutant lizardfolk who exhibit monstrous strength and regenerative capabilities. Almost twice as large as typical iruxis, raveniles have a more ferocious set of jaws and deadly claws. A ravenile's tail is much shorter than that of lizardfolk, however, lacking the heft to make it an effective natural weapon. Raveniles are as intelligent as their iruxi cousins, though many assume they are mindless brutes from their bestial appearance.
Raveniles hatch from eggs fertilized not by other iruxis, but by predatory extraplanar scavengers. Many lizardfolk tell stories—some true, some merely myth—of these scavengers to reinforce cultural taboos against leaving eggs undefended. At birth, raveniles look like other iruxi children, though perhaps they exhibit small hints of what they will become: a stubbier tail, wider feet, or a single tusk-like tooth. As raveniles age, they develop an increased appetite and metabolism. During one painful week at the cusp of maturity, raveniles experience an agonizing growth spurt. They shed their skin at least twice a day, their muscle mass increases exponentially, and their bones crack and reset. During this transformation, raveniles experience immense pain and exhibit reflexive violence. When the transformation is complete, the ravenile regains their wits, but by then, they've usually caused irreparable harm. Few lizardfolk communities welcome raveniles after their transformation, and some settlements suffer so much damage that they must be abandoned entirely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Raven Swarm.
A flock of ravens is known as an unkindness. Certainly the name lives up to its meaning when a swarm of ravens decides to work together. In most cases, a raven swarm like the one presented here won't attack larger foes, but when manipulated by supernatural forces or simple desperation born from hunger, an unkindness of ravens can be a surprisingly dangerous foe.
Given enough time to develop the relationship and establish what you want, it is possible to engage a raven in a sort of trade. Placing a small, shiny object where the raven can take it might entice it to grab the prize and fly off, returning 3d6 minutes later with something from its own stash. Convincing a raven to trade requires a DC 20 Nature check to Command an Animal and, of course, a raven who has the inclination to trade with you in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Redcap.
Redcaps are sadistic and capricious fey who thrill in bloodletting and murder. While they are most famous for appearing as wizened, bearded men, redcap women are no less fearsome or cruel. Redcaps are ultimately craven bullies, cowed by anything more powerful than themselves, a trait that leads them to fear and despise the symbols of good deities. Many fairy tales explain how the redcaps draw power from dipping the hats for which they are named in fresh blood. Just as iconic to these cruel little fey are their iron-clad boots, and the clanging sound of their metal soles clanking on stone floors is both discordant and disconcerting— especially to those who recognize the sound for what it is. Redcaps typically stand only 3 feet tall, with hunched frames, pointed ears, crooked teeth, and long, white, tangled hair.
A redcap's boots and cap are of little value to other creatures, but it carries a scythe and various valuable trophies from its kills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Reefclaw.
Reefclaws are aquatic monsters that resemble huge shrimp or lobsters. As one might expect from its name, a reefclaw’s oversized claws are powerful weapons with their vicelike grip and the ability to inject potent venom into unfortunate prey.
While reefclaws can’t speak, they are intelligent enough to understand the local language of humanoids near their hunting grounds. The creatures sometimes listen to conversations, either to gain intelligence on the best place to ambush aquatic or land-dwelling prey, or merely for entertainment value—reefclaws are particularly fond of listening to people with high-pitched voices. Reefclaws are usually solitary hunters, but small swarms of female reefclaws have been known to gather around a single male for mating purposes or together for the communal raising of their broods. In the latter case, the females will perform widespread hunts in order to bring back a large enough bounty to feed their young. Such hunting parties are extremely dangerous—they’ve been known to tip over small flshing boats and attack those who fall overboard.
Once a reefclaw has decided upon a course of action, it follows through even if doing so spells its own end. More than one reefclaw survivor has said that the creature released its bone-crushing grasp only after its brains were leaking from its broken skull, and even then the reefclaw was able to perform a terrible last slash as part of its dying breath. During mating season, female reefclaws are often a little more pragmatic and release their prey before endangering themselves and their offspring.
Despite their intelligence and the accompanying moral quandaries, reefclaws frequently find their way onto the dinner plates of land-dwelling hunters such as humans and hobgoblins. According to those who have a taste for reefclaw flesh, the meat is either delectably sweet (for reefclaws raised in colder waters) or slightly tangy (in the case of warm-water reefclaws). Most civilized people who know of reefclaws’ intellect find the act of eating them distasteful, but this does not dissuade unscrupulous nobles in coastal regions, for whom reefclaw meat is a delicacy well worth the expense. Likewise, fisherfolk whose focus is on the bottom line of their ledgers are more than willing to hunt the dangerous creatures—or, even better, hire out the task to naive adventurers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Reef Octopus.
The common reef octopus is a risky but valuable catch for coastal fishers.
The octopuses presented here are smaller versions of the much larger giant octopus, but other species exist as well. The brightly colored seafire octopus occupies a predatory niche somewhere between the reef octopus and giant octopus—its bite injects a venom that causes a painful rash and nausea. The immense grisly octopus is among the largest of its kind. It can swallow humans whole and can squirt particularly sticky crimson ink to incapacitate prey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Remnant of Barzillai.
Though the Silver Ravens defeated the evil tyrant Barzillai Thrune before he could fully realize his goal of becoming a genius loci, remnants of his spirit remain throughout the Ravounel region. On occasion, these scraps of sentience form a vague, Barzillai-shaped body from bits of the nearby terrain, but when near haunted locations, the spectral force can coalesce into a more precise body using ectoplasm siphoned from these haunts. In either form, the remnant carries a form of Barzillai’s own burning mace, which dissolves into a thin mist 1 hour after the remnant is destroyed.
Remnants of Barzillai can manifest anywhere throughout Ravounel, and even after one remnant is defeated, another might arise later on. The undead inquisitor can be put to rest permanently only by retrieving his mace before it disappears, then burying it in a location consecrated by good clerics, where it must remain for at least a year undisturbed.
While a remnant of Barzillai can draw power from any haunt it is associated with, remnants tend to do so with specific haunts. The haunts presented on pages 27–28 are commonly associated with remnants of Barzillai. These are far from the only haunts Barzillai can create, however; the Silver Ravens’ records mention many phenomena associated with the undead being, some of which deal with themes of various birds, the scents of mint and tea, and ghostly figures in heavy armor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Remorhaz.
A remorhaz is an enormous arctic predator that resembles a multilegged insect with draconic features. This monster has chitinous plates and more than a score segmented legs, a multipartite maw, and winglike growths fianking its head. The most unusual aspect of the creature, however, is its internal heat, which burns with such intensity that it causes the armored plates on the creature’s back to become superheated whenever the beast is agitated.
Remorhazes are carnivores. Their diet includes arctic animals such as elk, but a hungry remorhaz readily devours anything it can catch and kill. It commonly lurks beneath ice or snow and ambushes prey with a sudden upward strike. Many victims die before even knowing what attacked them.
Those who survive the worm’s initial onslaught must face not only its deadly jaws, but also its hideously hot body. This heat can melt weapons, scorch armor, and burn flesh—all tactics the remorhaz uses to disable and defeat its foes. A remorhaz’s internal fire allows it to burrow through ice and snow with ease. It leaves smooth tunnels in its wake as melted ice refreezes to leave the telltale signs of its passage. Most people underestimate a remorhaz’s intelligence, assuming it to be a mere animal. However, remorhazes are capable of learning languages. Frost giants in particular use this trait to form alliances with them. The giants provide food, protection, and shelter for the worm, and in return the remorhaz acts as a guard beast and helps the giants build fortresses and forge metal weapons. The giants also employ the worms as war beasts, using them to undermine enemy positions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Revenant.
Revenants are obsessed, undead stalkers who arise from their own murders and are driven by only one thing: revenge against their killers. The common wisdom is that revenants arise only from individuals who have been utterly betrayed or abandoned to die a grueling death, but even then such victims might not rise from their graves. In other cases, revenants might even rise from what might legitimately be considered an accident if the revenant doesn't understand the full circumstances of their demise. In such cases, it doesn't matter that the “murderer” may not have intended to kill, for revenants understands no pity and can never forgive. Revenants have little memory of their lives other than anything they might need to recall in order to achieve their goal of vengeance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Rhinoceros.
Rhinoceroses are short-tempered, territorial, and easily startled, and these traits combined with their innate ferocity means their natural instinct when disturbed is to attack. When intruders disturb or surprise rhinoceroses, the animals respond by charging directly at the interlopers and then lashing out with their mighty horns.
While some species have only a single horn, many rhinos, including woolly rhinos, have a second, smaller horn on their brow directly behind the larger one. Despite their appearance and durability, rhino horns aren't bone or ivory, but rather are composed of the same substance as hooves and toenails. A rhino's horn continues to grow as it ages, enabling a rhino to slowly regrow a broken horn. While some value rhino horns as trophies, the horns themselves have no intrinsic value.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Riding Dog.
Riding dogs types include larger dogs, such as mastiffs, wolfhounds, and huskies, and are bred often by halflings and gnomes to serve as mounts. Riding dogs are as loyal and devoted to their masters as guard dogs, and are ferocious in battle, regardless of whether they bear a rider or not. As with guard dogs, these large hounds can be wild or feral in nature, and, in some cases, might rival packs of wolves with regard to the danger they pose to inhabitants of rural areas.
While many societies adore dogs and value them for their loyalty as pets, no affliction other than rabies can reverse sentiments about these creatures quite so easily. While many animals can be afflicted with this debilitating illness, something about a loyal family pet growing feral and violent as a result of the disease makes it that much worse.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Riding Horse.
<i>This entry did not have a separate description for the creature.</i>
Goblins have many superstitions and quirks, but few of them are stronger than their fear and hatred of horses. This isn’t a one-sided affair. Horses also fear and hate goblins, and some have been known to go out of their way to harm a goblin. A goblin trying to mount a horse is nearly always subject to a torrent of violent bucking, as the horse does everything in its power to fling the goblin to the ground and within reach of its hooves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Describe a River Drake.
Although the glistening scales and sleek, fin-like wings on these drakes give them an appearance reminiscent of river sh, they are actually distant relatives of the black dragon. While smaller than most drakes, river drakes are more than capable of plaguing river travelers and are equally at home above and below the water’s surface. This flexibility allows them to catch a wide variety of prey, from fish and boggards to deer and the occasional ferry passenger.
Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.
While drake hides aren’t any more valuable than those of other, similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. While they are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.
A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.
A drake egg has Hardness 3, 5 HP, and BT 5. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.
Once a drake hatches, it imprints on the first creature that it sees. A creature imprinted on in this way gains a +5 bonus to Nature checks to train or command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the region, the type of drake, and the exact purpose the buyer has in mind, but typically depends on the level of the drake. Because drakes are evil, dangerous, and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.
It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconfidence, or general lack of skill.
Drakes reach maturity and reproduce much earlier than dragons, meaning that they are a far more common threat than their more powerful forebears. Drakes have few qualms about dwelling with one another (provided they are the same species), often establishing dens in pockets of wilderness suitable to their needs, such as swampy grottoes, shallow shoreline caves, or cliffside perches.
The allure of hunting a dragon is difficult to resist for many adventurers, but accomplishing such a task is fraught with peril. Unscrupulous adventurers have been known to instead hunt drakes and use trophies harvested from these creatures to deceive locals.
While the different species of drakes are adapted to different climates and environments, many drakes share similar preferences regarding nest location, searching out high places that offer cover from above, such as cliffside or mountaintop caverns, jungle canopies, and so on.
While every adventurer knows that dragon hide can be crafted into potent armor or weapons, drake hide holds no such intrinsic value. Nonetheless, drake scales and horns are physically impressive, and to the uneducated buyer, might seem at first glance to be legitimate. Unscrupulous leatherworkers have been known to use drake hides to craft and sell counterfeit dragonhide armor, so potential buyers should remain on the lookout for scams.
Drakes share dragon’s interest in treasure, but lack dragons’ discerning taste. A drake hoard will certainly contain coins, jewelry, gemstones, gear, and even the odd magic item or two, but the bulk of the hoard invariably consists of broken weapons, shiny rocks, bits of junk, and other doubtful pieces of refuse.
Although drakes and dragons are related to one another, little love is lost between them, and even the most territorial drakes know better than to remain in a dragon's territory longer than they have to. In rare cases, large rampages of drakes band together to attack an encroaching dragon, especially if the dragon is young and inexperienced.
The drakes presented on these pages are far from the only types that exist. Forest drakes have green hides, spit acidic clouds, and can be found in temperate woodlands. Rift drakes, among the most powerful of their kind, spit clinging caustic vapors and dwell in badlands and regions scarred by devastating magical disasters. Sea drakes can be found in oceans across the world, lava drakes in volcanic crevasses, mist drakes along coastlines and in salt marshes, and spire drakes in ragged, rocky hills. Undoubtedly, many other types of drakes lurk in the far corners of the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Roc.
Legendarily massive raptors capable of carrying off elephants as prey, rocs are typically about 30 feet long from beak to tail and have a wingspan of 80 feet or more. While their beaks are hooked to rip flesh from bone, their hunting strategy involves grabbing their prey in their powerful talons and then dropping it from great heights before feeding. This method creates a massive amount of carrion, which guarantees that rocs are followed by flocks of opportunistic scavengers, such as ravens and buzzards, who find it easy to steal bits of the larger birds’ meals. Rocs, for the most part, don’t mind these creatures, which sometimes get gobbled up along with the rest of the roc’s food.
Rocs usually nest among mountaintops and cliffs inaccessible to all but the bravest of terrestrial dwellers. They are long-range predators that hunt both land and sea in search for massive prey to sustain them and their young. Rocs are antisocial and lone hunters who compete with each other in fierce aerial battles to protect territory. But about once a decade, a mating couple pairs up to raise their chicks. Once the chicks are old enough to hunt on their own, the parents separate to once again engage in lone hunting.
Particularly skilled druids or rangers might capture and train a roc to serve as a flying mount or hunting companion, though examples of such an incredible feat of domestication are few and far between. The easiest way to rear a roc is to do so from the moment it hatches, since the chick imprints on the first creature it sees. Acquiring a roc egg is by no means an easy feat, though, and is often a death sentence for the would-be egg-snatcher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Roper.
To all but the most sharp-eyed underground explorers, a roper appears to be nothing more than a large stalactite, stalagmite, or pillar of ice. Cunning and patient ambush predators, ropers use this to their advantage.
Ropers do not form large societies (although they can often be found living alongside other deep-dwelling denizens), but they often congregate in small clusters and sometimes hunt in groups. Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and death and the flner points of the more cruel and sinister religions of the world, a roper can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought merely to eat. Quick-thinking spelunkers can sometimes stave off a roper’s appetite by entertaining it with stories or discussions of philosophy, but ropers do not willingly allow such intriguing prey to escape alive. Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don’t eventually escape, the ropers’ appetites win out over their intellectual curiosity—especially in cases where the pets constantly outmaneuver their keepers’ wits and patience. A roper is 9 feet tall and weighs 2,200 pounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Rune Giant.
Magically crafted and bred by ancient wizards, rune giants are anathema to and tyrants among their own kind, who were given power to command and magically control other giants. The rune giants themselves served even more powerful masters—potent wizards known as runelords—and in so doing commanded entire armies of giants on behalf of the runelords’ empires. In the eons since these empires collapsed, rune giants have persisted as a people of their own, though to the outside world they’re little more than fabled horrors whispered of late at night by superstitious giants. Rune giants usually dwell in the most remote and rugged of towering mountain ranges, but they can also be found in immense ruins atop lost islands, glacial valleys, or even more remote or magical regions.
Rune giants’ striking charcoal flesh is decorated by dozens of runes, which are potent manifestations of their eldritch powers. Rune giants are towering creatures, averaging at 40 feet in height and weighing 25,000 pounds.
Giants often keep an eclectic collection of treasures in their knapsacks or bags. Among these can be found a staggeringly wide range of unexpected and odd treasures and valuables.
As oversized as they are, giants tend to dwell in remote regions of the world, where they have the luxury of claiming larger territories of their own.
As with many people, giants enjoy keeping pets. Yet for giants, what constitutes a pet is often categorized as beast to others. Large animals like bears and lions, and megafauna like woolly mammoths and dinosaurs are popular, as are more magical creatures like hell hounds, manticores, griffons, and the like.
Beyond the giants detailed here, many others dwell in remote regions of the world. Marsh giants are cultists who worship strange sea deities, shadow giants have ties to the Shadow Plane, and mountain giants are horrific butchers even other giants fear.
Giants are larger-than-life foes. While many giants have themes that tie them to elemental or magical forces, the primary theme giants share is that they embody a classic cultural trope as their basis. Fire giants, for example, can be seen as oversized smiths, while hill giants should evoke the flavor of an oversized bully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Rusalka.
These androgynous, river-dwelling fey delight in manipulating the emotions of those unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp, using humiliation to break their victims' wills. Rusalkas enjoy keeping their broken toys nearby, both for continuing entertainment and to aid in the rusalkas' defense, as the shame their captives feel often drives them to become obsessively loyal to these fey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Rust Monster.
Found in lost dungeons, deep caves, and abandoned mines, rust monsters are a bane to any adventurers who rely on armor, weapons, or other metal items. These strange-looking creatures grow to about 5 feet long, with four insectile legs and a long tail ending in a four-pronged appendage resembling a tiny windmill. However, it is the rust monster’s feathery antennae that strike fear in the hearts of battle-hardened warriors, for a single touch from even just one antenna can reduce an adventurer’s most valuable tools to a useless pile of rust.
Rust monsters aren’t inherently aggressive creatures, but they’re voracious oxidivores, meaning they consume the rust created by their antennae. The creatures savagely attack anything that gets between them and a possible meal, and they relentlessly pursue any source of metal. A rust monster can be distracted by a single metal-rich item, but they are often encountered in groups of three or more, sharply raising the cost of escape.
Rust monsters are a terrible scourge in mining communities. If a group of rust monsters discovers rich veins of ore, they can multiply quickly. By weakening tunnels, attacking workers, and consuming the source of the miners’ livelihood, these aberrations have created many mountainside ghost towns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sabosan.
Sabosans are evil, intelligent, bat-like humanoids who live in warm forests and drink the blood of other creatures, particularly people. They have thin, emaciated torsos and broad, leathery wings that can reach a span of almost 20 feet. Sabosans’ heads, necks, shoulders, and upper chests are covered with red or dark-brown fur that barely obscures their stretched.thin flesh. Their ears are large and pointed like a batfs, and indeed they can echolocate to locate prey much like bats can, though their eyes are also capable of seeing in low light.
Some believe that sabosans are distant descendants of humans who were afflicted with vampirism but managed to avoid succumbing to undeath. Others posit they were once a tribe of demon worshippers whose dark rites transformed them into their current forms. No matter their true origins, sabosans have infamous reputations among residents of towns and cities south of the equator. Even mere rumors of sabosans in an area are enough to set off city-wide hunts, and the truly superstitious arenft above setting fires near every grotto, nook, and foxhole they come across in order to smoke out the nocturnal creatures.
Sabosans hunt during the twilight hours or just after dark, when their echolocation gives them a predatory edge over their sleeping prey. They are capable hunters but indiscriminating when it comes to food sources; their rapid metabolisms means sabosans must eat nearly 20 pounds of meat and fruit per day (supplemented, naturally, with copious amounts of blood).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sacristan.
Sacristans are failures among the velstracs, creatures whose bodies and minds have been utterly broken by the velstracs' torments. These unfortunates are assembled from scrap metal, nerveless flesh, and bits of darkness into loyal agents who take ecstatic pleasure in serving other velstracs. Sacristans are empowered by a miniature gateway to the Shadow Plane deep in their mouths. By distending their jaws, they can howl with the shrieks and windstorms of that plane. Sacristans vary in appearance but are the size of maimed humans. Their features are redundant or absent and they are wrapped in barbed and rusted chains.
Velstracs manifest from the souls of masochistic or sadistic mortals that are diverted into the Shadow Plane and then forged into forms that suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the aesthetics-obsessed interlocutors.
Some mortals refer to velstracs as “kytons,” a misattribution that the velstracs tolerate with cold amusement. The term “kyton” denotes a master or virtuoso among their kind, and these fiends enjoy being labeled masters of their horrid paths to perfection through agony.

Velstracs originated with the first debased thoughts of mortals, which the gods found so deplorable that they locked all velstracs away in Hell. It wasn’t long, however, before the newly formed race of velstracs escaped their infernal prison to the Shadow Plane.

Scholars grimly joke that there are as many different kinds of velstracs as there are ways to skin a cat. The relatively diminutive cantor velstrac poisons the minds of its victims so that they believe they are being clawed from the inside out. The mighty eremites, on the other hand, seek out the most powerful beings to subsume into their own form and lord over all other velstracs save the demagogues.
There are as many different velstracs as there are ways to inflict pain. Other velstracs range in power from the relatively weak lampadariuses to the powerful phylacators.
Many velstracs outsource the forging of their chains to unique velstracs known as almoners. These six-armed, legless humanoids toil endlessly at a great burning foundry called the Shadow Forge. Almoners operate under mysterious strictures, and are just as likely to turn a velstrac away empty-handed as not.
Many velstracs forge their own chains, but others outsource the task to unique velstracs known as almoners. These blind, deaf, and mute velstracs resemble six-armed halflings severed at the waist that toil away endlessly at a great burning foundry called the Shadow Forge. Almoners operate under mysterious strictures, and are just as likely to turn a velstrac away empty-handed as they are to hand one a finely crafted chain before the request has even been uttered.
The most powerful velstracs are unique divinities known collectively as demagogues—powerful creatures often worshipped by mortals who seek to experience agonizing new revelations and gain power by enhancing the body through pain.

Velstracs are most often encountered in the shadowy realm of Nidal, where the state worship of Zon-Kuthon is rigidly enforced. Indeed, many velstracs are created from the souls of Joyful Things, devotees of Zon-Kuthon who have had their limbs amputated to focus their minds on the veneration of pain, sacrifice, and torment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Salamander.
Salamanders have serpentine lower torsos, but humanoid upper bodies with toothy reptilian snouts. Their affinity for cruelty and violence puts them in close alliance with the demons of the Abyss.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
More than other elementals, fire elementals tend to deviate from neutrality, and are often good, evil, or chaotic in nature. Lawful fire elementals are rare. Fire's inherently capricious nature seems to prevent these creatures from succumbing to the influence of order.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Often, nothing remains after defeating a fire elemental but a pile of ashes and the fading smell of smoke. But sometimes, fragments of their elemental power remain behind. At the GM's discretion, a fire elemental can leave behind ashes, lumps of charcoal, or ever-smoldering cinders that are valuable components for the construction of fire-themed magic items.
Though fire and water classically oppose one another, in the right mixture they can become a dangerous combination. Water elementals heated to a scalding temperature through natural factors such as underwater volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent fire damage with their Strikes, while fire elementals infused with moisture might exude clouds of obscuring or even blinding steam.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sandpoint Devil.
While some creatures have been fused to create a new entity that's graceful and beautiful, the Sandpoint Devil is the opposite. It has the hooves and body of a powerful horse, but it walks on its hind legs in a perverse parody of a humanoid gait. Its equine face has been distorted and elongated with skeletal, yellowed fangs and milky eyes. The pox-spotted hide along the creature's back bears a draconic tail with dark, spiny plates and two torn, bat-like wings.
The legendary Sandpoint Devil appears only on moonless nights when mists gather around the coast. Most encounters end with missing livestock or children, with little left behind other than oddly placed hoofprints that reek of brimstone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sand Sentry.
Shifting back and forth between a detailed likeness of a human and a muted and featureless bipedal form, this creature of pure sand moves with an eerie grace. The sand sentry is often called upon by spellcasters to stand guard over an area of great importance—these elementals are patient participants in such roles, making them well suited for long-term service.

The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Earth elementals sometimes have valuable gemstones or minerals incorporated into their bodies, and once they are slain, these valuables can be scavenged as treasure. Gemstones, precious metals such as silver or gold ore, or rarer materials such as mithral or adamantine can be harvested from these creatures, although the more expensive finds tend to be incorporated into only the most powerful earth elementals.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sard.
An immense, gnarled, tree awoken with raw, primal power by one of the fey Eldest of the First World, this monster—one of the legendary Tane—skitters on huge, spidery roots and thrashes its branches as fiery lightning courses within its blackened bark, a living manifestation of the violent clash between ancient forest and stormy sky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sarglagon (Drowning Devil).
Sarglagons dwell in Hell's myriad waterways, lakes, and oceans. They serve as guardians of the Academy of Lies—the repository of secrets in Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell. Sarglagons breathe water and air with equal ease, and can move through water, land, and even air with uncanny swiftness. Few fiends travel the waterways of the multiverse, but where a river crosses the planes, odds are sarglagons have traveled it to further their infernal machinations. The only body of water they avoid is the River Styx, as the fiends have yet to develop any defense against that waterway's memory-sapping qualities. Mortal spellcasters sometimes bind sarglagons as guardians of precious secrets or treasures, particularly in aquatic areas. Most strangely, sarglagons sometimes act as unnerving caretakers to mortals who have no idea what they did to earn their unwanted protectors' attention. The constant uninvited vigilance of these devils is often disturbing and stifling to their wards.
At any one time, eight archdevils rule the eight upper layers of Hell, while the deepest layer is ruled by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a unique demigod with a dedicated role in guiding the infernal machine forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city. Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries, and Belial designs new weapons for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the oldest archdevil and keeper of many secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs armies. Baalzebul is a brooding archdevil who has fallen from Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty Mephistopheles was formed from the plane of Hell itself.
Many unique and powerful devils hold positions of power in Hell. The most numerous of these are the infernal dukes, many of whom were promoted to this position from already impressive statures as pit fiends. The supreme ruler of Hell itself is Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness. Between these two tiers rule the eight archdevils—see the sidebar on the facing page.
The nine layers of Hell are the planar home of all devils, and they much prefer its tyrannically ordered environs to anywhere else in the multiverse. Yet devils can be encountered anywhere mortals can be tempted by infernal bargains or seek diabolic aid. On Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is particularly aligned with Hell. Its government is based upon Hellʼs organization, and the state church is that of Asmodeus.
Devils view daemonsʼ constant hunt for souls as a short-sighted waste of potential, and demonsʼ chaotic destruction of society and flesh as uncivilized and obnoxious, but they do not loathe their fiendish counterparts. Indeed, most devils are more than willing to take advantage of daemons and demons as they can to further their own machinations.
Stinking, sulfurous hellfire is infused with evil. Hellfire always deals a combination of fire damage and evil damage, though the specific ratio depends on the hellfire's origin. Certain types of hellfire can impose other effects on creatures as well, such as sapping their strength or memories.
While travel to and from Hell is possible with plane shift, another way to reach and traverse the infernal realms is via hellmouths, strange living portals connecting different layers or even different planes. A hellmouth takes the form of a grimacing face, distended maw, or other distressingly organic aperture, and no two share the same appearance. Most are carefully guarded, but some new or well-hidden hellmouths have yet to be discovered.
The devils presented on these pages are a small sampling of the torments Hell has to offer. Other devils, like the inquisition-focused bone devils, the cherub-faced and fly-bodied accuser devils, and the aquatic drowning devil are a few examples of these widespread immortal creatures.
The four queens of the night wield great power in the Pit. Ardad Lili is a plotter and manipulator with ambitions of ruling the heavens, while Doloras revels in suffering. Most distant is Mahathallah, watching over fate and death. Mightiest among them is Eiseth, who is assembling an army in Dis in the hopes of claiming the iron throne of Malebolge.
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little use for compassion or empathy. As such, it exists entirely within a strict hierarchy, and this order extends to its denizens. While different types of demons correspond to various sins and daemons are associated with modes of mortal death, the different types of devils exist solely to fulfill particular roles in the infernal machine. On occasion, a particular devil can transcend the role for which they were literally shaped, but this often transforms the devil physically into the type suitable for their new role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Satyr.
To a satyr, life is a party and everyone is invited. Notorious for their hedonism, these fey believe there’s no greater beauty than can be found in song, drink, indulgent meals, and carnal pleasures. Satyrs use their enchanting songs and natural charm to encourage all manner of people to follow their true desires and free themselves from society’s rules. This usually involves enticing mortals to join raucous parties or engage in trysts in moonlit glades. If a potential companion rejects a satyr’s advances, however, the satyr has little interest in continuing a conversation and goes off to find more amenable revelers.
The lifestyle of a satyr leaves no room for ongoing affairs or long-term friends. Once his party is over or his lust is satiated, the satyr disappears back into the forest. The offspring satyrs leave behind are satyrs themselves, and usually end up being taken from their cradles by other fey rather than being left in mortals’ care. Satyrs are always male.
The untouched beauty of the forest is sacred and precious to a satyr. Brutish intruders who clear-cut trees or massacre animals without eating them risk drawing a satyr’s ire. A satyr so provoked uses his spells to undermine foes and attempts to dispatch them either with brutal ambushes or by leading a rush of forest animals to attack.
Other fey, particularly good fey, look upon satyrs as loutish, embarrassing cousins. They’re rarely hostile toward satyrs, but most find them insufferable and advise any mortals they like to steer clear of satyrs’ glades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Saurian Warmonger.
These saurians adopt warfare as their primary role and greatest calling. They particularly excel at taking slaves.
Saurians' immense physical strength and incredible longevity make them natural stewards of other powerful creatures such as dinosaurs and mammoths. However, they would never call these creatures “domesticated,” a concept they find particularly reprehensible.
Garund, with its warm tropical climes and epic mountain ranges, hosts the largest populations of saurians around the Inner Sea, but explorers claim that southern Arcadia is home to even more. Saurians have also been reported dwelling in vaults throughout the Darklands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Saurian Worldwatcher.
The longest-lived saurians favor introspection and take the long view of things—though this thoughtfulness should not be mistaken for weakness. Other saurians defer to worldwatchers' experience.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Scarecrow.
A ramshackle collection of materials in a human shape, the scarecrow construct is indistinguishable from a normal scarecrow until it slowly creaks to life. As it animates, its carved pumpkin or sackcloth face bursts into eldritch flame, sending fear creeping into the air around it. Each scarecrow is handcrafted and unique in its appearance, though most are 5 to 6 feet tall and constructed of a combination of wood, cloth, rope, straw, sawdust, discarded husks and cobs, and similar materials, all dressed in ragged pastoral garments. This rudimentary construction makes a scarecrow somewhat fragile, prone to snapping limbs in the crush of battle. Yet its structure is adaptable, allowing it to reshape another piece of itself into a clawed limb or grip a severed portion of itself to swat at its foes.
When a scarecrow is created, it must be anointed with a drop of its creator's blood into each of its eyes. This blood soaks into the material and siphons a tiny sliver of the creator's soul away—not enough to harm the creator, but more than enough to imbue the scarecrow with an instinctive intellect that allows it to follow commands as eagerly as a well-trained (if ill-tempered) guard dog. When a scarecrow is destroyed, the blood leaks back out from its eyes, but the portion of the creator's soul never returns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sceaduinar.
Strange creatures born from jagged crystals in the heart of the Negative Energy Plane, sceaduinar are fueled by its negative energy and driven to extinguish all life. Resembling crystalline gargoyles with serrated limbs and sharp, bat-like faces, sceaduinar stand about 7 feet tall and weigh around 100 pounds.
These malevolent beings sometimes gather in great packs of their own kind. Despite their intelligence, they act like cunning, feral beasts for the most part, though they occasionally build tools to aid them in extinguishing life. Sceaduinar sail through the great voids of their home plane, seeking to destroy any sparks of life that find their way into that deadly realm—even the twisted sparks found in undead creatures.
When they discover portals to other planes, sceaduinar swarm through in great numbers, slaughtering all they come across. While dwelling outside the Negative Energy plane is uncomfortable for sceaduinar, they can exist for extended periods of time apart from their home. Of course, the feeling of a plane where negative energy isn't the rule doesn't improve these creatures' attitude, and as a result, they tend to be particularly cruel and violent when encountered in such realms.
Sceaduinar congregate on the great crystalline knots of negative energy that accrete in the Negative Energy Plane. Sceaduinar prod treelike crystal growths to produce dangerous items akin to spheres of annihilation or great structures that echo with eerie chimes. Sceaduinar also stimulate these aggregations of crystals to yield other sceaduinar and similar hateful creatures of unlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Scorpion Swarm.
While a single scorpion is itself a menace, swarms of these vermin can be outright devastating. These skittering droves of death swiftly bring down their prey before devouring everything short of the victim’s bones.
While scorpions are often symbols of death or evil, their venom can be extracted and used for a wide variety of medical applications. A character can milk an incapacitated giant scorpion to extract raw scorpion venom, which can be used as raw materials to craft giant scorpion venom or lesser antiplague. To determine the value of ingredients you gain each day and the DC of the appropriate Medicine or Lore check, use the level 3 task entry in Table 4–2: Income Earned.
Those rescued from death in the burning sands often recount the same dying vision: a strange, silver-eyed woman whose scarlet silk tents stand on the back of a colossal black scorpion, riding out of a shattered city and leading an army of the dead across a sea of glass toward the world of the living. Millennium-old paintings on the walls of rediscovered tombs depict a similar desert rider. The identity of this red-robed woman is unknown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Scythe Tree.
Malevolent, vicious, and cruel, scythe trees pose as normal trees near deep forest paths, where they wait to slaughter passersby. Instead of drawing sustenance from light and soil, scythe trees gorge themselves on the flesh, blood, and bone of sapient creatures. Nothing is more delectable to scythe trees than a kind-hearted gnome or an altruistic dryad who believes that a scythe tree can be redeemed. The screams and whimpers of these victims are music to these cruel plants and add an extra dimension of flavor to the meal.
Scythe trees are solitary creatures by nature, and their size and power mean that they don't need to compete for food with other carnivorous plants. Once food sources dwindle in an area, scythe trees move on to another location. When a scythe tree dwells in a location for many months or years, it leaves traces of its bark and roots in the soil. Over time, these blood-nourished fragments might grow into a new scythe tree, but the progenitor will most likely have already moved on to new hunting grounds long before the new scythe tree reaches maturity.
Scythe trees appear as dead or dying deciduous trees with long, twisted branches that end in scythe-like blades. These carnivorous plants have dark-brown bark that is nearly black near the bottom of the trunk and rusty brown leaves that remain attached year-round. Scythe trees' disturbing mouths remain closed when not eating, appearing as a jagged gash on the trunk. When scythe trees deign to speak, their voices are rough, deep, and mocking, particularly when discussing arboreals, whom scythe trees universally find to be insufferable and worthy of little more than being hacked to pieces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sea Devil Baron.
Unlike in many cultures, the highest-ranking sea devils are expected not just to wade into battle alongside their brethren, but to actively lead the campaign.
Far from mindless monstrosities, sea devils are terribly intelligent, with a cunning limited only by their strict adherence to hierarchy. They call themselves “sahuagin” but have wholly embraced their enemies’ name for their kind as their own. Their cultural militancy enables sea devils to act in concert to perform grand acts of sabotage, marauding, and pillaging, and only the strongest (and most conniving) members of the tribe make it to the top of the social ladder. For all their discipline, however, sea devils are widely known to snap into murderous frenzies at the scent of blood. Even the best-laid plans can fall apart when a sea devil breaks ranks to revel in the spilled blood of their victims, an indulgence that can quickly cause a chain reaction of bloodthirsty ecstasy throughout an entire raiding party. For this reason, sea devils typically capture landborne quarry using nets and ropes, dragging them to the depths of the sea before making even a single incision.
Mutant DevilsSea devils are prone to mutations, the most common of which is the manifestation of two additional arms. These mutated sea devils almost always rise to power as barons. Other mutations occur as well, but few are as strange as those that result in sea devils who look almost like aquatic elves— save for a row of sharp teeth in their mouths.
Sea devils dwell in most of the world's oceans, and they view all others as enemies. When alliances occur, they usually take place with singularly powerful allies, such as aquatic dragons, krakens, or powerful humanoid villains. Diplomacy, to a sea devil, typically consists of violence and warfare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sea Devil Brute.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Sea Devil Scout.
Scouts, among the lowliest (and most disposable) of sea devils, ply the inky waters of the ocean in search of aquatic prey, tread ashore to gauge landborne threats, or charge into battle with the advance forces of a greater sea devil war party.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Sea Drake.
Long and slender, sea drakes have fins down the length of their backs and webbing between their talons, making them just as adapted for gliding through ocean waves as the skies above. More solitary than most drakes, they hunt and live alone. Although most sea drakes make their roosts high on ocean-facing cliffs, it isn't unheard of for them to dwell in underwater caves, living entirely aquatic lives.
Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.
While drake hides aren’t any more valuable than those of other, similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. While they are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.
A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.
A drake egg has Hardness 3, 5 HP, and BT 5. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.
Once a drake hatches, it imprints on the first creature that it sees. A creature imprinted on in this way gains a +5 bonus to Nature checks to train or command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the region, the type of drake, and the exact purpose the buyer has in mind, but typically depends on the level of the drake. Because drakes are evil, dangerous, and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.
It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconfidence, or general lack of skill.
Drakes reach maturity and reproduce much earlier than dragons, meaning that they are a far more common threat than their more powerful forebears. Drakes have few qualms about dwelling with one another (provided they are the same species), often establishing dens in pockets of wilderness suitable to their needs, such as swampy grottoes, shallow shoreline caves, or cliffside perches.
The allure of hunting a dragon is difficult to resist for many adventurers, but accomplishing such a task is fraught with peril. Unscrupulous adventurers have been known to instead hunt drakes and use trophies harvested from these creatures to deceive locals.
While the different species of drakes are adapted to different climates and environments, many drakes share similar preferences regarding nest location, searching out high places that offer cover from above, such as cliffside or mountaintop caverns, jungle canopies, and so on.
While every adventurer knows that dragon hide can be crafted into potent armor or weapons, drake hide holds no such intrinsic value. Nonetheless, drake scales and horns are physically impressive, and to the uneducated buyer, might seem at first glance to be legitimate. Unscrupulous leatherworkers have been known to use drake hides to craft and sell counterfeit dragonhide armor, so potential buyers should remain on the lookout for scams.
Drakes share dragon’s interest in treasure, but lack dragons’ discerning taste. A drake hoard will certainly contain coins, jewelry, gemstones, gear, and even the odd magic item or two, but the bulk of the hoard invariably consists of broken weapons, shiny rocks, bits of junk, and other doubtful pieces of refuse.
Although drakes and dragons are related to one another, little love is lost between them, and even the most territorial drakes know better than to remain in a dragon's territory longer than they have to. In rare cases, large rampages of drakes band together to attack an encroaching dragon, especially if the dragon is young and inexperienced.
The drakes presented on these pages are far from the only types that exist. Forest drakes have green hides, spit acidic clouds, and can be found in temperate woodlands. Rift drakes, among the most powerful of their kind, spit clinging caustic vapors and dwell in badlands and regions scarred by devastating magical disasters. Sea drakes can be found in oceans across the world, lava drakes in volcanic crevasses, mist drakes along coastlines and in salt marshes, and spire drakes in ragged, rocky hills. Undoubtedly, many other types of drakes lurk in the far corners of the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sea Hag.
Sea hags kill and eat fishers and sailors who come near their lairs, torment coastal dwellers with dark promises and vague threats, and enjoy the act of causing distress and discord in small towns. They generally avoid making their lairs too close to civilization, however, to avoid drawing enemies to their homes. Sea hags are known for tempting desperate victims into tragic and inescapable bargains, deals which the hag has already secretly stacked in her favor. Despite their voracious appetites, sea hags appear hideously emaciated, and unlike more powerful hags, they lack the ability to magically disguise their form.
Sea hags can join covens, but their aquatic nature often prevents them from joining mixed covens with other kinds of hags.
Hags are dangerous enough on their own, but when they gather in threes to form covens, they grow much more powerful.
Hags loathe all humanoid races, but not equally—the brunt of their wrath is leveled against humans. Hags prey on human society the most, adding human flesh to their cauldron and snatching newborn children before replacing the babes with their own progeny as changelings.
The four types of hags presented here are but the most notorious of their kind. Others—such as the blood hag, moon hag, storm hag, and winter hag—plague society in other regions of the world.
Some believe that hags possess no true form or body of their own, but instead manifest from society’s fear of aging. That no known male hags exist has also puzzled scholars, but perhaps this is but another way in which hags mock society—by presenting themselves as awful stereotypes of elderly women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sea Serpent.
These fabled beasts resemble massive snakes with long rows of finned spines down their back. Temperamental and territorial, sea serpents can capsize a boat with ease, and most won’t hesitate to do so when hungry or threatened. Stories abound of aggrieved captains who spend their entire lives hunting down the elusive monster that sunk their ships and took their livelihoods. These hunts rely on rumors and glimpses of the beasts, as few survive the catastrophes wrought by sea serpents.
While many fishermen’s tales paint sea serpents as divinely appointed guardians of the ocean or, alternately, as evil and demonic agents, the truth is that most sea serpents are simply very large beasts with a knack for avoiding magical detection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sea Snake.
These lithe snakes like to frequent the shallow waters of tropical seas. Their 4-foot-long, blue-green bodies easily blend into the water where they lurk to ambush prey. Tales speak of massive sea snakes that swim in deeper waters and follow ships, waiting for sailors to fall overboard or climbing the side to snatch them from the deck.
Snakes of all sorts eat their meals by devouring their prey whole. After incapacitating a creature, a snake unhinges its jaw and consumes the creature entirely, even if it's more than twice the diameter of the snake's body. A snake can consume a creature of the same size as itself or smaller, but most snakes are logy and sluggish while the meal digests.
Snakeskin's distinctive pattern and wide variety of applications makes it a sought-after resource, and the hides of extra-large snakes such as giant anacondas can fetch a fine price in the right market. Such oversized snake hides can be used to craft clothing of snakeskin leather, including boots and gloves, as well as other items such as scabbards, backpacks, and even tents or makeshift boats. A snake's hide can be cleanly removed with a successful Crafting check or appropriate Lore check.
Snakes appear frequently and prominently in the myths and legends of many cultures throughout the Inner Sea region. In Ancient Osirion, snakes were revered and associated both with the evil serpent god Apep and the good goddess Wadjet, the Green Empress. Perhaps the best-known example of snakes in Golarion's legends are the serpentfolk— serpentine humanoids who ruled vast swaths of the world in prehistoric times and worshipped a foul snake deity called Ydersius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sewer Ooze.
These amorphous masses of sewage and other detritus make their way through filthy culverts beneath cities large and small.
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms are usually found near each other, as the two oozes are part of the same life cycle. When a giant amoeba grows large enough, it can spontaneously split apart into two separate amoeba swarms, and when an amoeba swarm feeds enough, its individual components can fuse together into a single creature.
Many oozes have acidic attacks that can quickly degrade flesh, wood, and even stronger materials. Some believe that oozes are the result of alchemical or magical experimentation run amok, while others postulate that they simply emerged from the natural processes of evolution.
Many varieties of these nearly mindless predators exist in the world. Some are mere variants, with different colored puddings, jellies, and oozes with little to differentiate them from those presented here other than their habitat. Others are more specialized, or even dangerously intelligent. The shoggoth is one such example, but another variety of deadly and powerful ooze is the thankfully rare blight, a creature composed of protoplasm and eyes that curses entire regions with its presence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shadow.
The mysterious undead known as shadows lurk in dark places and feed on those who stray too far from the light. Those who parley with shadows, typically by keeping them at bay with a glowing weapon, may learn great secrets, for they are ideal spies.
Shadows might lurk in any dimly lit area—a corner in a crumbling ruin, a room lit by flickering candles, or a shaded forest at dusk. They travel to and from the Shadow Plane, though it is unclear if they do so via their own magic or by aligning themselves with a more powerful being capable of such planar shifting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shadow Drake.
Shadow drakes are typically among the smallest and least powerful of their species. Most stand as tall and long as house cats and have charcoal-colored scales and membranous wings just translucent enough to pass for shadows. Attracted to shiny materials, they employ deception, teamwork, and even rudimentary traps to create opportunities to make off with ill-gotten gains. Shadow drakes have a particular fascination and admiration for umbral dragons—a notable exception to the norm for drakes and dragons.
Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range.

It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconfidence, or general lack of skill.
Drakes reach maturity and reproduce much earlier than dragons, meaning that they are a far more common threat than their more powerful forebears. Drakes have few qualms about dwelling with one another (provided they are the same species), often establishing dens in pockets of wilderness suitable to their needs, such as swampy grottoes, shallow shoreline caves, or cliffside perches.
The allure of hunting a dragon is difficult to resist for many adventurers, but accomplishing such a task is fraught with peril. Unscrupulous adventurers have been known to instead hunt drakes and use trophies harvested from these creatures to deceive locals.
While the different species of drakes are adapted to different climates and environments, many drakes share similar preferences regarding nest location, searching out high places that offer cover from above, such as cliffside or mountaintop caverns, jungle canopies, and so on.
While every adventurer knows that dragon hide can be crafted into potent armor or weapons, drake hide holds no such intrinsic value. Nonetheless, drake scales and horns are physically impressive, and to the uneducated buyer, might seem at first glance to be legitimate. Unscrupulous leatherworkers have been known to use drake hides to craft and sell counterfeit dragonhide armor, so potential buyers should remain on the lookout for scams.
Drakes share dragon’s interest in treasure, but lack dragons’ discerning taste. A drake hoard will certainly contain coins, jewelry, gemstones, gear, and even the odd magic item or two, but the bulk of the hoard invariably consists of broken weapons, shiny rocks, bits of junk, and other doubtful pieces of refuse.
Although drakes and dragons are related to one another, little love is lost between them, and even the most territorial drakes know better than to remain in a dragon's territory longer than they have to. In rare cases, large rampages of drakes band together to attack an encroaching dragon, especially if the dragon is young and inexperienced.
The drakes presented on these pages are far from the only types that exist. Forest drakes have green hides, spit acidic clouds, and can be found in temperate woodlands. Rift drakes, among the most powerful of their kind, spit clinging caustic vapors and dwell in badlands and regions scarred by devastating magical disasters. Sea drakes can be found in oceans across the world, lava drakes in volcanic crevasses, mist drakes along coastlines and in salt marshes, and spire drakes in ragged, rocky hills. Undoubtedly, many other types of drakes lurk in the far corners of the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shadow Giant.
Shadow giants are fierce natives of the Shadow Plane, where they have dwelled in perpetual twilight for millennia. Their cultures vary greatly depending on whether the giants reside in their land of origin or have relocated to the Material Plane. On the Shadow Plane, they live in familiar groups and uphold a nomadic way of life as they roam across ancestral lands between shadowy forests and misty chasms. These hunter-gatherers pass down lore through oral histories, conduct pilgrimages to unholy ziggurats of black stone, and bathe in the blood of their long-standing foes, including rival shadow giant clans and velstracs intent on enslaving their kind. On the Material Plane, conversely, they are secretive and isolationist, keeping apart from other peoples in forbidding structures of black stone in high, isolated mountain valleys.
Standing 15 feet tall, with gray skin and hair only a shade lighter, shadow giants are fearsome foes with a well-earned reputation as zealous warmongers and ruthless combatants. They rarely interact with outsiders, though they may treat with proven warriors who show the giants the respect and deference they feel they deserve. Only a small subset of shadow giants worship Zon-Kuthon, and most of these Kuthites are so firmly entrenched in the culture of Nidal that their Shadow Plane-dwelling kin would hardly recognize them. Most shadow giants instead practice an ancient religion, unique to their people, with its own bloody themes of sacrifice and self-mutilation.
Giants often keep an eclectic collection of treasures in their knapsacks or bags. Among these can be found a staggeringly wide range of unexpected and odd treasures and valuables.
As oversized as they are, giants tend to dwell in remote regions of the world, where they have the luxury of claiming larger territories of their own.
As with many people, giants enjoy keeping pets. Yet for giants, what constitutes a pet is often categorized as beast to others. Large animals like bears and lions, and megafauna like woolly mammoths and dinosaurs are popular, as are more magical creatures like hell hounds, manticores, griffons, and the like.
Beyond the giants detailed here, many others dwell in remote regions of the world. Marsh giants are cultists who worship strange sea deities, shadow giants have ties to the Shadow Plane, and mountain giants are horrific butchers even other giants fear.
Giants are larger-than-life foes. While many giants have themes that tie them to elemental or magical forces, the primary theme giants share is that they embody a classic cultural trope as their basis. Fire giants, for example, can be seen as oversized smiths, while hill giants should evoke the flavor of an oversized bully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shaitan.
Hailing from the Plane of Earth, shaitans are proud and brazen genies. They value physical skill and love bargaining, games of chance, and working with metal and stone. Immense gemstones and veins of precious metal crisscross their home plane, and the industrious shaitans have built a vast mercantile empire from these abundant natural resources.
Genie nobles with titles unique to their kind (as detailed in each sidebar) rule genie society. Genie nobles are generally at least 5 levels higher than a typical example of their kind. In addition to the increased statistics afforded by their higher levels, genie nobles gain additional spells. But the most wondrous (and notorious) of a genie noble’s powers is their ability to grant wishes. Any genie noble (save for jann, who lack this power) can grant a mortal or undead creature up to three wishes within a year’s time. Many unscrupulous creatures compel genie nobles to serve them, tricking them or entrapping them with magic. However, once a genie noble grants a third wish to a single creature, they are freed from service to that creature forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shambler.
Shamblers are cunning carnivorous plants that resemble heaps of wet, rotting vegetation. Even when standing erect on their stumpy legs, shamblers don’t have much in the way of identifiable anatomy; they are tangles of parasitic vines that lash out at prey with their longest creepers, entwined together to deliver powerful blows. Sometimes called “shambling mounds,” these ambush predators have a particular fondness for flesh, and are most well known for their ability to hunker down and hide in plain sight. A shambler can draw nutrients from plant matter or soil, but won’t do so if it suspects meat might soon wander near, and indeed may lie in wait for days in anticipation of such a meal.
Shamblers are usually solitary creatures. Fierce thunderstorms are among the few events that bring numerous shamblers together. During such gatherings, the plants gather around strange but seemingly sacred earthen mounds in remote jungles and swamps and cavort and caper excitedly, stretching their tendrils toward the sky to hope for—or perhaps to summon—intense lightning strikes. Not only are these strange plants unharmed by even the most powerful electrical strikes, but they seem to become supernaturally empowered by such bursts of raw energy. Shamblers consider being struck by lightning a sign of divine favor, and those shamblers frequently blasted by bolts of electricity become respected (and powerful) elders among their kind. Shambler elders are few and far between and may possess a wide array of abilities; some can cast primal spells, others can empathically call upon the aid of other shamblers in the area, and still others wield awesome powers over electricity.
Other types of shamblers exist, including those composed not of plant matter but fungal growth. These creatures, known as “spore mounds,” discharge clouds of toxic spores from their bodies when struck in combat. In semiarid deserts, shambler-like plants called tanglethorns dwell amid sagebrush and rock formations; they resemble bunches of tumbleweeds and cacti and in ict deep, bloody lacerations with their attacks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shatterling.
Shatterlings have a fixation on mirrors that gives them a strange affinity for reflective surfaces. These creeping, wicked fey stand barely 3 feet high and look like hunched humanoids made of shifting panes of jagged mirror glass. Shatterlings usually inhabit areas with plenty of mirrors, like carnival fun houses, opulent manors, or playhouses. Capricious and malevolent, shatterlings quickly kill or scare away anyone else in such areas, as they desire to be the only ones to gaze into the mirrors they claim as their own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shemhazian (Mutilation Demon).
Shemhazians rise from the souls of torturers and those who reveled in mutilating the physical bodies of their victims. Standing 35 feet tall, a shemhazian is well equipped with a wide range of talons, claws, and fangs to continue inflicting such torments on those it encounters.
Shemhazians delight in visiting torment upon mortals, of course, but more than most demons, these fiends revel in sharing the pain with their own kind. Other demons fear and hate shemhazians for this reason, with only the most powerful willing to work with a shemhazian to achieve a shared goal. Even then, the shemhazian is always on the watch for an opportunity to bring pain and suffering to its allies along with any foe.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications. For planar ally, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.
The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.
The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.
Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.
When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.
The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.
The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.
While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.
Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shield Archon.
Shield archons defend the fortresses of Heaven against fiendish incursions. They wield their spears and shields in massive formations capable of withstanding any onslaught. Beneath their armor, they are sheathed in skin of steel. Given their tremendous strength and imposing stature, shield archons are ideal guardians of the meek and are sometimes summoned to the Material Plane to ward off the attacks of great numbers of evildoers.
Archons live in the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven. They manifest in the Garden at the mountain’s peak from mortal souls who answer a mysterious voice. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms. Intensely orderly in their metamorphosis, new archons begin as lantern archons or other lesser forms, transforming into ever-greater archons as their virtue and achievements grow. Each archon represents a particular virtue, such as hope, charity, justice, or courage, and they gain strength in the presence of mortals who exemplify this virtue. Due to their extremely lawful nature, archons sometimes find themselves at odds with azatas.
While archons do not seek to gather or maintain wealth, they do appreciate beauty and art, and their domains are often decorated with valuable crafts and creative works. Their armor and weapons are similarly ornate, and they always clean and polish their gear after battle. Archons value order—and thus tidiness—in all things.
As with angels and azatas, the most powerful of archons are a caste of demigods known collectively as empyreal lords. Each archon empyreal lord is a unique and powerful creature that keeps a domain somewhere in Heaven and is worshipped on Material Plane worlds. Archon divinities serve a variety of goals and focus on different aspects of righteousness. Some, such as Zohls, hold influence over the pursuit of truth and determined investigations, while others, like Damerrich, the demigod of executions, emphasize the punishment of unrepentant wrongdoers and seek to obliterate evil in all its forms.
When a spirit becomes an archon, they usually start as a lantern archon, the lowliest of archonkind. As they perform noble deeds and bolster their pureness of heart, an archon evolves into greater forms, possibly skipping stages or remaining in others for long spans of time, depending on their particular strengths and personality.
While commonly found in Heaven, archons can also be encountered on the fiendish planes in their endless crusade against evil. On the Material Plane they are usually encountered as advisors or saviors to those in need.
Always ready to defend others, most archons are never encountered out of their suits of armor. Even those who eschew armor, such as the bastion archon, tend to still appear as if they are wearing heavy protection against the scourge of battle.
Archons reside in Heaven, a plane that appears as a single massive mountain. Heaven is broken into seven tiers, with most archons occupying the second level and base of army operations, Proelera, or the sixth level, Iudica, the administrative heart of Heaven.
Many other archons than those presented here patrol Heaven or crusade in the fiendish planes, including the resolute hound archon soldiers and sentinels, and the supreme bastion archons, who rank among Heaven’s most powerful defenders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shining Child.
Shining children are wicked, enigmatic monsters that roam remote planes and untraveled corners of the universe in search of esoteric lore. With their abnormally gaunt frames, long white hair, and unnerving, four-fingered hands, shining children are both strangely familiar and otherworldly in appearance, though they are barely visible within the shroud of blinding light they continually emit. Their faces are truly horrible, however, as their overlarge eyes and distended, gaping mouths reveal their heads to be voids filled with unnatural light. Shining children use this light as a weapon, weaving illusions and focusing beams of fiery brilliance.
Because of their reputation as scholars of the alien and the eldritch, shining children are sometimes summoned by powerful wizards or occultists in search of rare knowledge. The creatures never give away their lore without some price, though, and typically demand in return the performance of contemptible deeds that further their inscrutable, far-ranging plans.
These mysterious beings are natives of the Astral Plane. In that vast plane, accretions of metaphysical matter gradually accumulate and eventually coalesce into demiplanes. During this tumultuous process, sparks of living light sometimes shear off the newly formed planes, and these sparks of raw planar energy somehow transform into shining children. Every newly formed demiplane leaves a different mental imprint on its shining “offspring,” making it easy for shining children to telepathically recognize their brothers and sisters. Forever trapped in apparently adolescent bodies, shining children dedicate themselves to scholarship and violence with equal measure in a futile effort to understand their roles in the multiverse and the burning injustice of their births.
Shining children confuse most other creatures with their refusal to use individual names in favor of alternating between referring to each other singularly and collectively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shoal Linnorm.
Shoal linnorms occupy rocky shoreline shallows and slither along lonely coastlines. While they do not intentionally seek out large settlements, these linnorms nonetheless beleaguer fishers headed out from small coastal towns, and they may even follow skiffs back to their home port to appraise the town's defenses and plan a raid. Shoal linnorms tend to hunt large prey, both underwater and on land. Their preferred quarries includes giant squid and grizzly bears—meals rich in fat, which the linnorms metabolize into the fiery steam that courses through their veins.
The death curses of the linnorms are often the subjects of tragic sagas, and those who would think themselves vanquishing heroes for slaying a linnorm often meet their dooms soon thereafter, succumbing to these curses well after the death of the linnorm responsible for bestowing it.
Linnorms have a deep connection to the First World, the primordial home of the fey. While linnorms typically won't think twice before devouring a gnome or other fey, they do have an unusual respect for wielders of powerful primal magic. The only way to cow a linnorm, according to common wisdom, is to remind it that there are forces of nature even stronger than itself.
In the storied Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the slaying of a linnorm is traditionally required for those who would claim a nation’s crown. Recently, though, the Linnorm King White Estrid claimed her crown not by slaying a linnorm but by beating it into submission, gaining a powerful and dangerous ally to help secure her rule.
Creatures as powerful as linnorms tend to spawn stories of their own, accurate or not. Critical failure on a check to Recall Knowledge on linnorms might suggest that you can avoid a linnorm's death curse by closing your eyes as you deliver the fatal blow, or that rubbing poison oak on yourself can ward off a linnorm's attention.
As with true dragons, linnorms tend to amass immense piles of treasure in their lairs. These hoards consist of the weapons, gear, and belongings of would-be vanquishers more often than minted coins or works of art.
Almost all linnorms lead solitary lives; they are too reprehensible for even their own kind to tolerate for any length of time. Most species do not even meet to reproduce; rather, female linnorms usually deposit a solitary egg in a remote location, which a wandering male linnorm then fertilizes and places in a nook suitable for incubation. Newborn linnorms range in size from that of adult crocodiles to full-grown bulls, and their growth is rapid. Even a juvenile linnorm is strong enough to wreak havoc on a small settlement— though most don't dare to commit such audacious pillaging, for fear of evoking the anger of another, larger linnorm in the area.
Linnorms exist in a variety of forms beyond the four detailed here. The gaunt cairn linnorm, the spiny taiga linnorm, and the aquatic fjord linnorm each terrorize their own specific regions of the Material Plane.
While the linnorms presented here and in the first Bestiary constitute the majority of these creatures, others exist, particularly in the remote regions of the First World. It may be that these rare linnorms simply find the Material Plane too constraining for their might!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shocker Lizard.
These brightly colored reptiles share the rough size and pack mentality of guard dogs, roaming in small groups. Shocker lizards have specialized glands under their scales that accumulate static electricity, and they can unleash blasts of lightning strong enough to harm significantly larger foes. Though they're meek and docile when encountered alone, shocker lizards are significantly more aggressive in packs, when they can amplify each other's electrical attacks.
Shocker lizards are notoriously difficult to domesticate because they're dangerously hostile as part of a pack, but will also swiftly wither and die if kept alone in captivity without constant attention. A shocker lizard is 3 feet long and weighs 25 pounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shoggoth.
Although even raving fanatics and doom-saying prophets desperately claim the monstrous shoggoth is nothing more than a drug-induced vision or a thankfully unreal nightmare, the truth is altogether more dire. Shoggoths exist, yet they tend keep to the deepest of ocean trenches or the most remote of caverns and ruins, emerging to spread chaos and destruction in their slimy wakes.
The first shoggoths were created by an alien species to serve as mindless beasts of burden. Their vast bulk, incredible strength, and amorphous nature made them useful slave labor, and their ability to spontaneously form whatever new eyes, mouths, limbs, and other organs they might need made them incredibly versatile. Eventually, the shoggoths developed enough intelligence to rebel against their masters, and now they lurk, patient but potent, in the lightless deeps.
A shoggoth has goals and methods unknowable to humanoid beings. They remember their eons of servitude and, compared to their mysterious masters, humans, elves, dwarves and other intelligent beings are mere specks which crawl upon the surface of the world, indistinguishable from animals. When a shoggoth rolls its immense, hideous body over a band of explorers, engulfing them in a gelatinous press of flesh and gnawing teeth, it is not so much evil as uncaring.
Shoggoths can become the object of worship for humanoid cults dedicated to chaos and entropy. The shoggoth does not respond to this worship, but it can be counted on to consume any hapless victim the cult can capture and sacrifice to it. Rumors of shoggoths that have developed even greater intellects are, one would hope, just that, for the damage a shoggoth capable of reasoning could wreak upon a world is unsettling to say the least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shoggti.
Shoggti travel to other planes in roving bands to capture and charm victims, bringing them back to the Abyss where they are enslaved for unknown—but no doubt insidiously evil—purposes. These squid-like qlippoth have slick, blue skin and four suckered tentacles that end in dexterous pincers. In addition to a lamprey-like mouth at the base of its body, each has a secondary maw in the middle of its forehead that stretches from between its two bulging eyes to the back of its head.
The qlippoth presented here are but a small fraction of the squirming awfulness that lurks in the deeper rifts of the Abyss. Other types of qlippoth include multi-armed, crab-like gongorinans, which use living creatures as incubators; shapeshifting utukku, which infiltrate and undermine religions; death-spawned behimirons, which slay the living to reproduce; and the living siege engines known as catabolignes. Yet most frightening of all is the immense iathavos, a monster so abhorrent that even the Abyss cannot bear to allow more than one to exist at any one time.
Qlippoth ruled the Abyss for eons and still see themselves as its rightful rulers. When the Abyss first began to spawn demons from the souls of sinful humanoids, the realm was plunged into a brutal war spanning untold millennia, in which qlippoth, though more powerful and established, were slowly but surely driven back by the endless demonic hordes who spawned far more quickly than qlippoth could ever hope to match. Today, qlippoth have been driven to the deepest, darkest corners of the Abyss where they cling tightly to the crumbling remains of their territory.
As qlippoth lost territory to their demonic rivals, they realized that the only way to stem the tide of demonic forces was to starve them of the sinful souls that the Abyss uses to spawn new demons. While qlippoth have no concept of how they might go about preventing sin by changing the way mortals act, they do understand that exterminating mortal life would solve the problem as well.
The most powerful qlippoth are quasi-deities themselves, ancient entities only rarely worshipped by non-qlippoth. Of these monstrous divinities, the Polymorph Plague, Yamasoth, is the most well-known. Others include Chavazvug the Crawling Inferno, Isph-Aun-Vuln the Feaster Within, and Thuskchoon the Everglutton.
Although it is widely accepted that qlippoth have lost incalculable territory in the Abyss to demonkind, these fiends still control vast regions in the deepest reaches of that plane. Some sages suggest the troubling possibility that perhaps qlippoth still hold more territory of the Abyss than demons do, but because demons are more concerned with mortal life, we simply interact with the layers they control more often. For all we know, these dour sages postulate, the Abyss teems with endless swarms of qlippoth that have yet to make their move against mortal life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shoony Hierarch.
For all their advancement in agriculture, horticulture, and animal husbandry, shoonies subscribe to a remarkably antiquated form of leadership; the role of hierarch is normally inherited, passed on to the oldest living child of the village’s previous hierarch. In the instance that the village’s hierarch does not produce an heir, the village holds a general election. Elected hierarchs hold the term for life and are just as highly regarded as hierarchs raised from birth. When the settlement comes under attack, it is up to the hierarch to decide when to fight and when to flee. In most cases, shoonies prefer to elect individuals with a preference toward the latter.
Shoonies have a rich oral history and claim that their kind flourished all around Kortos in the days when the living god Aroden walked among them. Many shoonies believe that Aroden himself personally created the shoonies after he raised the island from the bottom of the sea, and that he had a deep affinity for their people. Whether or not such tales of companionship with the god of humanity are true, shoonies have drastically declined in numbers since Aroden’s death over a hundred years ago. Shoony elders point to strange environmental phenomena around their island home as one cause of their diminishment, and others attribute their decline to the rise of warmongering monsters in the area. In a world where might often makes right, it is hardly a surprise that the peaceful but timid shoonies are becoming increasingly rare.
Shoonies typically lack the resources to smelt and forge metal tools, weapons, and armor in any major capacity. Instead, they trade with other peoples for these precious resources. Farming, fishing, and hunting tools made of metal are especially vital to the shoony way of life, so shoony clans maintain good relations with any other clans or villages willing to trade with them. In exchange, shoony crops and animals grown for food make for reliable trade offerings, though the exchange rate is such that a shoony clan might acquire only one metal tool in a poor growing season.
While many shoony settlements rely on staple crops such as barley and beans, talented shoony farmers rarely settle for such mundane produce. Rumors speak of fiddlehead ferns that increase the speed of one’s gait, cabbages that fortify against toxins, and carrots that grant improved vision. Because shoonies alone know the secret to cultivating such wondrous vegetables, and because such veggies still rot and expire like mundane produce, finding these rare foodstuffs outside the Isle of Kortos is practically impossible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Shoony Militia Member.
If shoonies had their way, war would cease to exist altogether, but they know this isn’t likely. Shoonies’ relative wealth of resources and their frailty compared to other humanoids make them a common target of violence and subjugation. Because of this, basic combat training is typically mandatory for all shoony village members. Few individuals pursue lifelong careers in service to their settlement’s militia, however. The passing down of a sword from one shoony soldier to another is a time-honored tradition, owing to the rarity of weapons in shoony society.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Shoony Tiller.
Nearly all shoonies in a given settlement are farmers, fishers, or foragers. Shoonies are not expected to fight to protect their settlements; most agree it is better to live in cowardice than to die with that foolish, intangible principle taller races call “honor.” Many shoonies hone their skill with tools rather than arms in the knowledge that whatever is lost to violence can be rebuilt. When cornered, a shoony may put up a fight with whatever they have on hand; the average shoony can wield a simple shovel or pick in melee as well as most humans can wield a sword.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Shuln.
Scourges of the upper Darklands, these enormous, mole-like monstrosities slice and burrow through solid stone with massive forearms and adamantine-strong claws. Shulns grow to about 20 feet long and have four tiny, nearly imperceptible eyes; a long, pale snout; four thick-muscled legs that end in long, serrated claws; and a stubby pink tail. As a young shuln matures, its unique metabolism produces adamantine that becomes infused throughout its skeletal system. In addition to making their claws and fangs nearly unbreakable, this unique physiological trait makes shulns unparalleled burrowers and highly sought by monster hunters who hope to harvest the precious material from their corpses.
Shulns have a ravenous appetite and eat nearly anything they can catch, but their preferred diet consists almost entirely of large invertebrates, especially cave worms. They rely on tiny sensory whiskers that cover their snoutfland allow them to detect subtle movements in the air and ground without the use of vision. When it detects suitable prey, a shuln bites the target at the first opportunity, injecting it with a potent paralytic toxin present in its saliva. So strong is this poison that it is capable of subduing even the near-unstoppable purple worm, making the shuln a valuable (if dangerous) companion to have for anyone making excursions into worm-infested regions of the Darklands. Shulns’ notoriously ill-tempered dispositions and their knack for digging into areas of an underground settlement where digging ought not occur makes them frustrating creatures to keep around, but when the alternative is an unpredictable but deadly visit from an enormous, hungry cave worm, the annoyances are well worth the trouble.
Encounters with much larger shuln-like entities on the Plane of Earth suggest that these creatures may have originated from that place. The larger shulns still retain their elemental qualities, are quite a bit smarter, and have their own suite of earth-themed innate primal spells—but for all that, they still love the taste of cave worm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Siege Shard.
Sieges provoke lingering feelings of confinement and desperation. These emotions can coalesce as a psychic presence that animates broken battlements as quasi-intelligent constructs dubbed siege shards. The shard's surface depicts the conflicts that created it, which hold the key to dispersing its psychic presence. A successful DC 18 check to Recall Knowledge is sufficient to identify the conflict that engendered the construct. A creature aware of a shard's generative conflict can attempt the following activity.Prove Peace ConcentrateManipulate
Source Pathfinder #157: Devil at the Dreaming Palace pg. 84
Requirements You know the conflict that created a specific siege shard, and the siege shard is immobilized.You touch the siege shard, establish a mental connection, and relay facts of the conflict's resolution. Attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about the conflict that created the shard, using the siege shard's Will DC. If you succeed, you prove the conflict's end, and the siege shard reverts to ordinary stone. On a critical failure, images of the past conflict overwhelm you, and you are confused until the end of your next turn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Simurgh.
Desert-dwelling people consider the sight of a simurgh a herald to a lifetime’s worth of luck, and those who are unfamiliar with the majestic beast might mistake it for the avatar of a deity. Beautiful, graceful, and truly gargantuan, the simurgh resembles nothing so much as a massive multicolored bird with the head of an equally enormous and regal lupine. Simurghs act as intermediaries in world-threatening conflicts, serving as agents of good deities or vigilantes who spread their own brand of justice, typically by obliterating or banishing evil extraplanar beings.
Simurghs can live for thousands of years, and because these ancient beings are so rare many doubt their existence. But they are very real, as those who have been aided by a simurgh can enthusiastically attest. A simurgh does not show itself often, but when it does, it is typically in response to a truly grave threat, such as the incursion of an undead army or the rampage of some truly epic monster. Simurghs are nothing if not paragons of righteousness, and goodly heroes can hardly find a better ally in their quest to vanquish evil than a simurgh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sinspawn.
Sinspawn were created by one of seven ancient wizards known collectively as runelords—each of whom embraced and embodied one of seven sins. The first sinspawn was created by the Runelord of Wrath, utilizing techniques that have since gone on to influence fleshwarping practices. It wasn’t long before the technique used to create sinspawn fell into the hands of the other runelords, and while each tried their own hand at crafting variants of their own design, today sinspawn of wrath remain the most numerous and notorious of their kind. Bearing only a vague resemblance to the humanoids from whose flesh they were formed, sinspawn generally appear horrifically emaciated and have unnaturally long arms and digitigrade legs, each with a trio of stubby, taloned digits. Veins bulge across sinspawn’s bodies in sanguine patterns that suspiciously resemble twisted runes, and their flesh is pale and hairless. Their heads are elongated, bearing only slits for a nose, red eyes, and disturbing lower jaws that split in half at the chin, revealing pedipalps that end in tiny, three-fingered hands and framing a long, lolling tongue. Sinspawn stand 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh as much as an emaciated human of their size. They behave in a manner consistent with their associated sin and have physical characteristics that hint at these qualities. For example, greedspawn’s veins appear to run with gold while envyspawn appear even more wasted than the rest of their kin.Sinspawn Sins When a sinspawn is created, it becomes associated with one of the seven sins: envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, or wrath. A sinspawn’s sin is determined by the runewell that spawned it or by its creator’s preferred sin, and cannot be changed. Each sin grants sinspawn associated with it additional benefits and abilities beyond those described by the sinspawn stat block, as detailed below.Envyspawn An envyspawn has Deception +7 and typically carries a halberd. They tend to be shorter and thinner than other sinspawn.
Melee halberd +10 (reach 10 feet, versatile S), Damage 1d10+4 piercing
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against an envyspawn’s sinful bite are enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. Gluttonyspawn A gluttonyspawn has Survival +10 and usually carries a scythe. They are obese, but hardy and strong.
Melee scythe +10 (deadly d10, trip), Damage 1d10+4 slashing
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a gluttonyspawn’s sinful bite are drained 1. Greedspawn A greedspawn has Thievery +9 and typically wields a glaive. They are the tallest of sinspawn, often 7 feet in height, and with gold-tinged veins.
Melee glaive +10 (deadly d8, forceful, reach 10 feet), Damage 1d8+4 slashing
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a greedspawn’s sinful bite are clumsy 2 for 1 minute. Lustspawn A lustspawn has Diplomacy +7 and usually carries a guisarme. They have attractive bodies, but hideous faces.
Melee guisarme +10 (reach 10 feet, trip), Damage 1d10+4 slashing
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a lustspawn’s sinful bite are stupefied 2 for 1 minute. Pridespawn A pridespawn has Intimidation +7 and often wields a maul. They are nearly skeletal in their gauntness, and often seek out fine clothes or jewelry to wear, taking strange pleasure in appearing elegant and regal.
Melee maul +10 (shove), Damage 1d12+4 bludgeoning
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a pridespawn’s sinful bite are clumsy 1 and enfeebled 1 for 1 minute. Slothspawn A slothspawn has Society +6 and usually carries a longspear. Thick rolls of excess skin drape the slothspawn’s hunched frame.
Melee longspear +10 (reach 10 feet), Damage 1d8+4 piercing
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a slothspawn’s sinful bite take a –10-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 1 minute. Wrathspawn The most commonly encountered of the sinspawn, a wrathspawn has Athletics +12 and typically wields a ranseur. These sinspawn are the bulkiest looking of their kind.
Melee ranseur + 10 (disarm, reach 10 feet), Damage 1d10+4 piercing
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a wrathspawn’s sinful bite are drained 1 as well as enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.
Sinspawn are found in regions where sources for their creation remain buried in ancient ruins—in Golarion, this currently limits them to the frontier lands of Varisia. But as they spread, so to does the potential knowledge of crafting more of them, and fleshwarpers around the world are hoping to someday soon craft new sinspawn of their own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Skaveling.
Hideous necromantic rituals give rise to skavelings, or ghoul bats, monstrosities that are not true ghouls but instead are specifically crafted undead creatures. Their creators are the bloodsucking urdefhans of the Darklands, who create skavelings from giant bats specially raised on diets of toxic fungus and the flesh of ghouls—especially brains harvested from these undead. Upon reaching maturity, these giant bats are ritually slain via the use of cytillesh oil. While this poison simply rots away the flesh of most creatures, one of these specially prepared bats will immediately rise from death as a skaveling after succumbing to its effects.
Despite its tattered wings and sagging skin, a skaveling is more than capable of flight, even when carrying a creature mounted on its back—urdefhans often use skavelings as mounts in this way. Their intelligence is more advanced than that of the typical giant bat, and in combat they function more as allies than as mere mounts, capable of making their own tactical decisions. Yet even though they can reason and think, skavelings remain loyal to the urdefhans who created them, and they never take actions in a fight that would knowingly put their masters in harm's way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Skeletal Champion.
These skeletons retain the cunning they possessed in life.
Most skeletons have one of these abilities. If you give a skeleton more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics.
Bloody The skeleton is covered in dripping blood and gains fast healing equal to its level.
Collapse Trigger The skeleton is critically hit. Effect The skeleton collapses into a pile of bones and the attack deals only normal damage. The skeleton can reform in a standing position as an action, but until it does, it is immobilized and fiat-footed.
Explosive Death When the skeleton is destroyed, its bones shatter and explode as the necromantic energy holding it together is released. Adjacent creatures take 1d6 slashing damage per 2 levels (minimum 1d6) with a basic Reflex save.
Screaming Skull (auditory, emotion, fear, mental) The skeleton removes its skull and throws it, making a jaws attack with a range of 20 feet. It then attempts to Demoralize each foe within 10 feet of the target. The head bounces, rolls, or even flies back, returning to the skeleton at the start of its next turn. The skeleton is blind until then.
The necromantic energies that infuse animated undead skeletons give them the ability to see without eyes and move without muscles. Despite being mindless, skeletons’ instinct to evil comes from their corrupt vital essence, perverting negative energy for creation rather than destruction.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Describe a Skinstitch.
Skinstitches' hulking frames are made from flayed humanoid skin stuffed with straw and poisonous insects. The dark god Norgorber grants the secrets for creating these monstrosities in disturbing dreams to select followers, informally referred to as skinstitchers.
While most skinstitches have vaguely humanoid shapes, they often appear monstrous due to various modifications their creators have made to their bodies. Some skinstitches' arms, for instance, may bear jagged metal blades or blunt iron rods. The most talented skinstitchers rarely bother with the humanoid form at all and instead opt to craft skinstitches that resemble other creatures sacred to Norgorber, such as scorpions, centipedes, or especially spiders. There are rumors of skinstitchers who can build skinstitches using exotic materials such as steel, daemon flesh, or even magical shadows.
The rotting materials used to build skinstitches tend to attract vermin, which may in turn make a hive or nest within the skinstitches' bodies. Skinstitchers consider such occurrences as a sure sign of Norgorber's approval.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Skrik Nettle.
The expansive skies of the First World are home to skrik nettles—delicate, bizarre-looking creatures that resemble large jellyfishes. A fringe of brightly colored feathers circles their bodies, and long tendrils trail from their center, each ending in a snapping beak. Known for their eerie, chirping melodies, skrik nettles soar above the First World in flocks of a dozen or more, diligently scavenging for food in the fey realm's cutthroat ecosystem. When hunting or provoked, skrik nettles attack their foes by injecting them with a magical poison that causes the victim to float helplessly up into the sky. Skrik nettles continuously inject this poison into their helpless prey until it dies or is so high up that the skrik nettle needs only wait for the poison to end, its meal crashing helplessly to the ground below.
Skrik nettles that find their way to the Material Plane (or any plane other than the First World, for that matter) tend to be much more aggressive, for the planar energies that they find comforting and soothing on the First World are conspicuously absent. The first few minutes after a skrik nettle arrives on any plane but the First World tend to be filled with violence and fear, as the panicking creature lashes out at any nearby creatures (including other skrik nettles) in the mistaken notion that these others are somehow responsible for the discomforting change. After 10 minutes or so, assuming the skrik nettle survives its bout of violence, the creature calms down somewhat and does its best to acclimate to its new home. Yet even skrik nettles who find themselves marooned beyond the First World for years never lose their longing for home, and they instinctively seek out portals to this plane for the rest of their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Skulk.
The cowardly and lazy skulks live on the fringes of organized societies and steal from others without a second thought. Even murder is merely another necessity, and they think nothing of creeping into a house, dispatching the residents, and taking what they want.
Their chameleon-like ability to blend into their surroundings makes skulks difficult to detect, so their ever-present populations around the periphery of large settlements are nearly impossible to dislodge permanently. They typically travel in small groups of no more than 16 individuals, since groups larger than that tend to break into violence directed at one other. While skulks see themselves as sharing a common history of being cast out and hated, this is not a strong enough bond to hold large groups of the creatures together with a shared purpose for very long.
Entrances and exits from cities, especially less-guarded access ways around sewers and the like, are skulks' favorite stomping grounds. These sites allow them to closely observe who comes and goes from the city while also affording them swift escape options, should the authorities uncover their presence. On rare occasions, a well-disciplined skulk can rise to prominence within the local thieves' guild and become sought after for difficult jobs. Their repugnant personalities and overwhelming selfishness, however, usually means they are unable to secure long-lasting leadership roles.
A typical skulk is 6 feet tall with similar body structure to a gangly human. Skulks mature quickly and can live up to 50 years, although most meet a violent end long before then. The rare skulk who manages to escape their society of violence and craven bitterness can be of any alignment, but those skulks who remain bound by their traditions always see these self-imposed exiles as the worst kind of traitors, and the exiles are often targeted for eradication to the exclusion of all other victims. More than one band of skulks has accidentally engineered its own doom after throwing caution to the wind and exposing its existence to the authorities in an ill-planned but violently passionate attempt to track down such an exile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Skulltaker.
Swirling down from misty peaks and through howling mountain passes like an evil wind, the vortex of bones known as a skulltaker is a terrible manifestation of the delirium and agony experienced by doomed climbers and lost trailblazers just before they met their end. In some places, a skulltaker is also known as a saxra.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Skum (Ulat-Kini).
The most numerous of the alghollthus are the ulat-kinis, a servitor race created from human stock to serve as rank-and-file soldiers in alghollthu armies. At the zenith of alghollthu power, ulat-kinis formed massive legions and enjoyed significant power over other species. When the alghollthus retreated from the world, they abandoned teeming hordes of ulatkinis. Although these erstwhile soldiers tried to continue their conquering ways, their numbers declined rapidly in battlefield defeats and purposeful exterminations enacted by their enemies. Ulat-kini society degenerated, so that now only a few enclaves exist in the depths of the earth or along isolated coastlines. Few remember their own species’ name, instead using the epithet their foes gave them: “skum.”
In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave societies and sought to wipe the slate clean—both starting anew and punishing those who had become too willful and rebellious. They used incredible magical power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they’d manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew strong once again—this time without alghollthu influence.
Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a frightening possibility—that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the surface once again.
The ruling castes of the alghollthu species dwell in oceanic depths or underground waterways, while their servitors like ulat-kinis and ugothols can often be found in coastal regions and marshes.
Although most alghollthus lack the greed that tempts most mortals, they do gather wealth and magical tools to use in their schemes. A given aboleth or veiled master might also wear magical jewelry and other objects. Faceless stalkers and other humanoid servants of alghollthus use weapons and armor, such as the faceless stalker’s sword or ulat-kini’s trident, as well as other tools. These servitor races can be as acquisitive as other humanoids.
While the veiled masters are the rulers of alghollthu society, they are not the most powerful of their kind. Greater, more mysterious creatures that function as organic thought networks, immense aquatic engines of war, or specialized extractors of forgotten secrets dwell among their sunken cities. Meanwhile, the world above remains infested with creatures that were originally created by the alghollthus but have long since drifted away from their aquatic progenitors to become their own sinister monstrosities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Slime Mold.
A slime mold appears as a mound of earth and detritus covered in a thick layer of fungus that exudes a faint stink of decay. The fungus actually shares a symbiotic relationship with the slime mold, serving as an external digestive system while gaining access to the nutrients it needs. The ooze remains perfectly still until living prey passes within reach, then it lashes out with disgusting pseudopods. With a touch, a slime mold can infect its prey with a foul contagion known as slime rot, a horrific disease that painfully breaks down a victim's flesh. At first, the disease manifests as painful rashes and agonized joints. In the later stages, though, the flesh of the affected creature actually begins to liquefy and run in rivulets as the creature's spores continue to work. Death, when it occurs, swiftly causes the resulting body to split open and release a brand new slime mold.
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms are usually found near each other, as the two oozes are part of the same life cycle. When a giant amoeba grows large enough, it can spontaneously split apart into two separate amoeba swarms, and when an amoeba swarm feeds enough, its individual components can fuse together into a single creature.
Many oozes have acidic attacks that can quickly degrade flesh, wood, and even stronger materials. Some believe that oozes are the result of alchemical or magical experimentation run amok, while others postulate that they simply emerged from the natural processes of evolution.
Many varieties of these nearly mindless predators exist in the world. Some are mere variants, with different colored puddings, jellies, and oozes with little to differentiate them from those presented here other than their habitat. Others are more specialized, or even dangerously intelligent. The shoggoth is one such example, but another variety of deadly and powerful ooze is the thankfully rare blight, a creature composed of protoplasm and eyes that curses entire regions with its presence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Slug.
These massive, primeval relatives of ordinary slugs squirm slowly through swamps and grasslands. Giant slugs are always voracious and prefer to eat flesh or plants high in water content. They frequently consume livestock or strip bare entire orchards or melon crops. For cattle, pigs, or other sizable meals, they first shred the creatures using their radula—tongue-like appendages covered in teeth— to make them easier to consume. The mucus secreted by a giant slug is powerfully acidic and viscous. Wherever it travels, the creature leaves a trailing brown strip that kills most vegetation. Farmers and ranchers, especially those living near swamps known to contain giant slugs, keep close tabs on these journeys. Many almanacs go into great detail on slug migration and mating seasons. Since each giant slug needs its own wide hunting ground, the creatures typically come into proximity to mate only once a year. Either or both slugs can become impregnated, and any that do typically lay a clutch of around 100 eggs. They usually lay these eggs in a shallow bog or a cool, humid cave.
Giant slugs tend to travel at night, as the creatures dislike sunlight and dry weather. They have been known to seek out locations like barns, the undersides of bridges, or even fortifications like castles for shelter as dawn starts to break. Woe to the unprepared farmer who ambles out at sunrise to milk the cows but instead finds that a giant slug has made the barn its home! Subterranean giant slugs don't have to worry about sunlight, and crawl about on no schedule in particular. Narrow tunnels pose little obstacle for them, as the creatures can easily compress their bodies. These factors make their movements very unpredictable, so they pose quite a menace for underground peoples like kobolds or xulgaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Slurk.
The slurk is a sticky, tusked frog-beast found in underground lairs and caves. It has two massive tusks, which it uses to gore prey and tangle with rival slurks. With the slurk’s natural ability to climb walls and cling effortlessly to ceilings, it can be easy for unwary cave explorers to end up on the wrong end of the beast’s formidable ivory tusks.
Slurks exude two very different types of foul-smelling secretions from their pale white skin. Large pustules on the slurk’s back drip a sticky resin-like slime that quickly hardens upon exposure to air. By flexing its skin, the slurk can burst these pustules in the direction of intruders, covering its foes in sticky goo and severely limiting their ability to withstand the monster’s other attacks, including the effects of its other secretion. Glands along the slurk’s ventral side excrete an incredibly slippery and fetid grease, which protects the slurk from the immobilizing effects of its own back slime but also has the added benefit of making it extremely difficult to grapple and capture. The best way to discover if a slurk is in the vicinity is to look for hard clumps of such grease, which accumulate and dry in cave corners and amid rock piles where the slurk rests between meals.
Slurks are thought to be descendants of a failed dwarven attempt to domesticate and breed large subterranean frogs as food and labor animals. Despite this apparent failure, slurks are often befriended by others who live underground. The sticky frog-beasts have proven extremely desirable to kobolds, who now domesticate and train slurks as powerful mounts and guardians. While other creatures, particularly boggards, sometimes train slurks to serve as guardians, kobolds remain those who use these creatures the most. A kobold mounted on a slurk will often hide in the upper ledges of a cave, using the advantages of height and surprise to harry foes with ranged attacks. Kobold riders also take advantage of the slurk’s ability to climb, and charge at their enemies from the walls of a cavern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Smilodon.
Smilodons are large saber-toothed cats, apex predators that are significantly more muscular and broader than the other species of big cats. They often kill prey with a quick stab to the throat or other vulnerable spot. The smilodon’s oversized fangs are particularly sought after as trophies.
Leopards are exceptionally adaptable, able to survive in any grassland, forest, or jungle, and even the fringes of deserts.
Lions live in grassy plains and savannas, although species adapted for temperate environs that dwell in mountains exist as well. Male mountain lions lack the mane of their somewhat larger grassland-dwelling kin, but are no less dangerous.
While tigers are most common in forests, they also inhabit grasslands and savannas as long as vegetation is dense, and their dens are often found in caves.
Smilodons live in wooded and grassland areas.
While it's common practice to keep a house cat in the home to ward off unwanted rodents, keeping a big cat for a pet is a different matter entirely. Nevertheless, up-and-coming merchant lords, impetuous princes and princesses, and status-obsessed nobles have tried to do just that, often resulting only in terrified house staff and ruined upholstery. Many among the idle rich will gladly pay for the services of an unscrupulous druid or ranger who promises to help them achieve their dreams of an oversized feline friend, but the dire risks of such an endeavor are enough to dissuade even the greediest would-be animal trainers from even attempting the feat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Snapping Flytrap.
The snapping flytrap is a ravenous, carnivorous plant that is quick to bite at any creature that passes by. Snapping flytraps typically have two sets of tooth-edged leaves, each measuring 3 feet wide, at the end of 10-foot-long stalks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Snapping Turtle.
Snapping turtles are freshwater reptiles with a long flexible neck, a sharp piercing beak, and a confrontational temperament that doesn't prevent some spellcasters from choosing these creatures as familiars. They weigh about 20 pounds and have shells around 18 inches in length.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sod Hound.
Sod hounds are mossy extraplanar canines formed of packed dirt and pebbles.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Earth elementals sometimes have valuable gemstones or minerals incorporated into their bodies, and once they are slain, these valuables can be scavenged as treasure. Gemstones, precious metals such as silver or gold ore, or rarer materials such as mithral or adamantine can be harvested from these creatures, although the more expensive finds tend to be incorporated into only the most powerful earth elementals.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Solar (Archangel).
Solars are among the greatest of all angels, ranking just below empyreal lords. Many solars serve at the right hand of a deity or champion a cause that benefits an entire world. Most archangels resemble humanoids, but not all—they can adopt more unusual forms as needed. A typical solar is about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with a commanding voice that is impossible to ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.
Solars are legendary trackers; the most masterful of them are said to be able to follow the centuries-old passage of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane.
The most powerful angels belong to a category of demigods known as the empyreal lords—a title shared with other powerful good-aligned demigods among the host of archons, azatas, and other inhabitants of the celestial planes. The most powerful and most well-known of the angelic empyreal lords is Sarenrae.
Angels normally live on Nirvana or other celestial planes, but their missions can bring them to the Material Plane. Spellcasters can conjure them for aid or advice in times of need, and they can even be found, if rarely, crusading against fiends in Hell, the Abyss, or anywhere in between.
Many angels wear exquisite armor or wield beautiful and often magical weapons. While they are not hampered by mortal sins like greed or pride (save for the very rare and tragic exception), they do enjoy the beauty of fine clothing, exquisite jewelry, and works of art.
The most powerful angels are known as the solars, but numerous others can be found in Nirvana working their own missions or goals. Angels generally appear as beautiful, often somewhat androgynous humanoids, and the most powerful often possess two or even four sets of feathered wings.
Three types of devas exist among the angelic host, all of which serve as angelic “field agents.” Of the types of angels, devas are the ones most likely to be encountered dwelling somewhere other than Nirvana, as these angels focus their work on cultivating and protecting goodness in mortal souls, be they living or dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Soulbound Doll.
Soulbound dolls are eerie mannequins or playthings that have been imbued with a small piece of a deceased mortal’s soul. These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons—such as to serve as companions or servants—but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct’s alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator’s Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor’s death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred
Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment’s power makes the doll’s flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person’s death, this doesn’t affect the deceased’s resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.
The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem (Hardness 10) typically embedded in the doll’s neck or chest. The soul fragment isn’t static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor’s or moving farther a eld on its own individual path. The soulbound doll’s focus gem retains the doll’s memories even after the doll’s destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Soulbound Ruin.
Those who tread in ruined places sometimes speak of a sense that a supernatural presence is there alongside them, as if the spirits of the dead were watching intently. Such presences can be very real, often taking the form of ghosts or other shades of undead that cannot let go of their attachment to the Material Plane. But sometimes, instead of manifesting as distinct spirits, the souls of the dead infuse the very stone and mortar around them. When enough souls attach themselves to a single place—be it a home, crypt, or castle—it can take on a life of its own, becoming a soulbound ruin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Soul Eater.
Only the most desperate or foolhardy conjurers call upon the aid of these strange fiends from the inky swamps of Abaddon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Spark Bat.
Spark bats congregate around volatile weather in the Plane of Air.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Spear Frog.
The spear frog is named for its toxin, which is traditionally used to envenom thrown projectiles like spears and daggers.
While all frogs are amphibious, some frogs spend more of their time out of the water. Even those usually found near lakes and streams are adapted for climbing. You can add variety to frog encounters by replacing a frog's swim Speed with a climb Speed (or even allowing it to have both). Likewise, for frogs that are poisonous or venomous, the specific effects of their toxin can vary by species, with exposure to some frog poison causing a creature to become clumsy or stupefied instead of enfeebled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Specter.
When an evil mortal creature dies, it sometimes returns to haunt the area of its death as a specter, a hateful remnant, always seeking to slay others—particularly humanoids—in an attempt to distribute its pain among as many souls as it can. A specter maintains a strange semblance of its prior identity, but with a corrupted sense of purpose. It cannot be reasoned with.
A specter denied the opportunity to harm living humanoids grows increasingly agonized and irrational, akin to the mindset of a starving person forever denied a release from agony through death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sphinx.
Sphinxes are mystical beings with the body of a lion, the wings of a great bird, and the upper torso and head of a human. They are often maligned in legends as nothing more than monsters, and though they are quick to anger and are capable of exacting deadly retribution for perceived slights, they are also very intelligent.
Sphinxes are often associated with desert regions, but they can dwell in more moderate climates as well. They form small groups consisting of a single, extended family that hunts and works together to protect and teach their young. As they mature, sphinxes develop a wanderlust, a drive to gather hidden lore and solve the world’s greatest riddles—the trait that is perhaps most often identified with their kind.
While sometimes bound into service as guardians for powerful spellcasters, lone sphinxes may also be encountered on journeys of discovery and as purveyors of esoteric lore. If treated with the proper respect—and fed well—a sphinx can demonstrate a willingness to exchange information. Their favorite currency is, of course, riddles and secrets. One who can trade knowledge for knowledge has a much better chance of succeeding while bargaining with a sphinx. However, a sphinx’s insatiable thirst for new riddles as well their extensive collection of secrets accumulated over hundreds of years of life—makes it difficult to offer them something they don’t already know. Those who attempt to trade petty insight and stale riddles may invoke a sphinx’s ire and will not live long enough to regret it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Spider Swarm.
An abundance of food, the sudden hatching of a clutch of eggs, or magical influence can cause smaller spiders to gather in terrifying, deadly masses.
Though they are vermin incapable of forming true alliances, spiders show up alongside many types of creatures, including web lurkers. Spellcasters sometimes call upon spiders using summon animal, and spider swarms have a way of popping up just about anywhere at the most inopportune times.
A staggering number of species of giant spider exist in the world. Some, like the dream spider, whose venom creates strange hallucinations, are relatively small. Others, like the lumbering ogre spider, are larger than horses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Spinosaurus.
The spinosaurus is more than just one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs—it's also one of the most unusual in appearance, with a large, sail-like fin running along its spine. Often quite colorful, this sail allows the spinosaurus to attract mates, aids in swimming, and makes it appear to be even larger than it actually is. A swimming spinosaurus can also use the sail as part of a unique means of staggering prey by slapping the water with it to make a crushing wave.
The spinosaurus is equally at home in water as it is on land, and its long, toothy maw is well-adapted to catching swimming prey. Attempts by giants to capture spinosauruses to serve as guardians typically go poorly, for these headstrong dinosaurs do not domesticate well. Their surly attitudes and striking appearances make them better suited for bloodsports, and they are popular prizes for those who run arenas specializing in battles that pit gladiators against hungry animals or beasts. Of course, an angry dinosaur forced to fight for the amusement of others won't discriminate between potential meals on the battleground and ones seated in the surrounding stands.
The spinosaurus's appearance and strength make it attractive to more than just giants and bloodsport organizers. Spellcasters who mutate and transform animals into magical guardians have long been intrigued by the spinosaurus's potential. More so than any other dinosaurs, spinosauruses have been subjected to fleshwarping procedures, crossbreeding with monsters, and other magical techniques to enhance the creatures' viability as effective guardians.
A spinosaurus can measure up to 60 feet in length and weighs 25,000 pounds.
While the real world fossil records hold a wealth of inspiration for the reconstruction of dinosaurs in an RPG, you can also look to living creatures for ideas. Giving a dinosaur a poisonous bite or an unusual attack routine like Clobbering Charge ensures that dinosaurs are as interesting in combat as they are in appearance.
As with most animals, dinosaurs can be tamed or domesticated, but the difficulty of this task increases along with the dinosaur’s level. Lizardfolk and orcs are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, workhorses, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In certain cities, dinosaurs are popularly featured as combatants in blood sports and other gladiatorial battles.
As animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear. Dinosaurs can also be harvested for rare and valuable trophies such as teeth, talons, armor plates, and the like.
At first glance, the inclusion of dinosaurs in a fantasy setting might seem strange, but dinosaurs are an excellent creature to use in a game that bridges the gap between familiar real-world animals and legendary monsters. If having dinosaurs mix freely with lions, manticores, and dragons still seems strange to you, consider having them dwell in remote, primeval lands, as suggested in the sidebars on pages 99–100. On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in the wilder regions of the world, particularly on the continent of Garund, though they are common enough that PCs might find some on display in a menagerie in a northern city, in use as guardian creatures, or even kept by druids as loyal animal companions.
Another classic place that dinosaurs are found in fiction are in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal place to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day‑night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam.
In a fantasy setting, magical effects or supernatural influences can enhance dinosaurs by giving them unexpected attacks, modes of movement, or other abilities. You can quickly create a memorable magical beast simply by giving a dinosaur the magical attack of another creature of an equal level, such as a spinosaurus gaining an acidic breath weapon akin to that of an adult black dragon.
A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or a quick online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well. Armor-headed pachycephalosaurs, spike-thumbed iguanodons, duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed spinosauruses, and more await discovery by those who would seek out the mysteries of the lost worlds where the thunder lizards still rule!
Dinosaurs fit well into certain types of settings. They’re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Spiral Centurion.
These mechanical constructs were created to serve as guardians in an ancient and bygone era, although exactly who made them and the secrets of their construction have long since been lost to history. From the waist up, they resemble humanoids made of metal, but from the waist down their bodies take the form of spinning metal tops ringed with blades, which excel at cutting down nearby foes. Most spiral centurions can be directed to stand down with a password, although often these command phrases have been lost to the mists of time. In rare cases, a spiral centurion may also wield manufactured weapons or a shield in addition to its built-in weapons, giving it access to additional actions besides those listed below.
Most spiral centurions are hundreds or even thousands of years old, only staying functional because of the powerful magic used in their creation. Still, millennia of neglect have caused many spiral centurions to develop small glitches or malfunctions.
Dulled Blades: Its blade Strike deals only 2d10+5 bludgeoning damage.
Misaligned Gears: It loses Rev Up, and if it Strides more than once per round, it takes 1d10 damage.
Stuck in a Rut: It uses the same actions each round, regardless of the circumstances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Spiritbound Aluum.
Whereas most aluums are animated by the souls of volunteers loyal to Katapesh, the Pactmasters created a handful of more capable (and deadly) aluums powered by the souls of a dozen or more dangerous criminals. These spiritbound aluums are rarely used as peacekeepers, instead serving as assassins, elite bodyguards, or riot control during times of martial law.
A spiritbound aluum has a dull blue crystalline focus that stores constituent souls, surrounded by a host of smaller gems used for trapping souls the Pactmasters wish to deny from entering the Great Beyond. Spiritbound aluums rarely use this soul-binding ability except when instructed by their masters. However, the murderous or embittered souls within the aluum sometimes exert control and willfully consume a departing soul either out of malice or to incorporate it into the construct’s core. If not relieved of its trapped souls in a timely manner, a spiritbound aluum can develop enough will to overcome its masters’ orders and even awaken to full sentience. These rogue aluums typically lose the mindless trait, are evil, have an Intelligence modifier of –2 or higher, and gain several skills with bonuses ranging from +25 to +32.
Retired Zephyr Guards are the most common soul donors bound within an aluum’s crystalline focus, typically agreeing to it early in their career in exchange for a higher salary.
Although members of the Zephyr Guard stop at nothing to detain and destroy rogue aluums, several such renegade spiritbound aluums remain at large.
Daemon of Dogtown: Following the Silk Riots of 4303 AR, the Pactmasters dispatched this aluum to eliminate straggling instigators. It succeeded, but not before gaining sentience and enacting a 3-day string of murders. Although officials claim it was destroyed, the so-called Daemon of Dogtown’s body was never actually recovered, leading to rumors that it still haunts the outskirts of Katapesh.
Queen Halkuar: Assigned to protect a gnoll emissary from the Spotted Hide pack, this aluum failed to protect its charge from assassins. Instinctively, it bound the gnoll’s soul, assumed the fabricated persona of “Queen Halkuar,” and fled into the hinterlands. The queen is said to still wander the wastes in search of additional “packmates.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Spirit Naga.
In naga culture, the foul-tempered, unkempt spirit naga holds a contemptible place similar to that of hags in humanoid cultures. These decrepit creatures live out lives of solitude, sought out only by those who are foolish or brave enough to think they can benefit from the spirit naga's powers without paying a heavy price—for most who dare to show such hubris, the price is their own lives.
Spirit nagas seek out desolate ruins and places long associated with death and corruption. These sinister, serpentine beings can be found in abandoned graveyards, crumbled fortresses, rotting swamps, and blighted woodlands. Though they may know little of the actual history of such places, the nagas are nonetheless attracted to the psychic remnants of evil deeds and tormented spirits that remain within the earth and stones there.
Despite their hideous appearance and treatment as pariahs by other nagas, spirit nagas feel a profound pride in their abilities and even in their hermetic existences. They see themselves as connected to a greater force whose mysteries are revealed only to those who can cast off the trappings and morals of “civilized” society. Even so, spirit nagas gleefully accept the worship of other creatures willing to bow to their capricious whims. They often form cults around themselves, using their charm spells and rituals to ensnare the minds of a few key individuals who spread the nagas' foul influence throughout a community.
Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society—an entire empire ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers with a patriotic pride that borders on worship.
Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins. In many cases, these nagas have heard of distant Nagajor, but they are usually unwilling to abandon their own pursuits to seek out a land where they might be worshipped as gods.
Dark nagas might rule over goblins, orcs, xulgaths, or decadent folk, especially corrupt aristocrats. Guardian nagas might be found with other goodly creatures of any sort, from fey in natural sites to constructs in ancient vaults.
Beyond the sinister dark naga and the benevolent guardian naga, many other types of nagas exist, including the mesmerizing spirit naga, the multiheaded royal naga, and the introspective and mysterious lunar naga.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sportlebore Swarm.
A swarm of sportlebores is a much more dangerous foe than a single insect.
While the creature presented here is the most common of its type, the sportlebore is in fact an entire family of insects that specialize in mimicking everyday objects. Other varieties of sportlebore include the spindly, wood-devouring wartlebore; the corpse-eating sportlegore; and the sportleglug, which is so small it can burrow into leather wineskins and drink their contents without the bag spilling a drop. Like the sportlebore, most of these vermin aren't too dangerous as individuals but can turn into a real problem if their numbers are left unchecked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Spriggan Bully.
The typical spriggan is a bully who prefers to take live prisoners in fights, but only to ensure that they have a large stock of living victims to torment, tease, and abuse. They train to use weapons in nonlethal ways that inflict the maximum amount of pain even as they guard against accidental death. When not bullying prisoners or hunting for new victims, spriggan bullies enjoy drinking, watching others fight, and fighting among themselves.
Love, happiness, and beauty have no meaning for nearly all spriggans, for their minds have long since abandoned the capacity to understand and enjoy such positivity in the world. Violence, malice, and distortion have expanded in spriggan society to fill the aching voids left behind by their ancient expunging of positivity. Today, the best a spriggan can manage in place of positive emotions is a muted satisfaction when they make another creature suffer.
Spriggans resemble muted, hairless gnomes with oversized, pointed ears and an alien, feral appearance. Many of them are gaunt and haggard. Skin tones vary across all different shades of blue, from a pale sky color to a deep midnight. Unlike their more cheerful and optimistic kin, spriggans do not become afflicted by the bleaching, a fact that many of their kind smugly hold up as proof that their ancestors’ choice to abandon joy was the right one.
While spriggans can specialize in a wide range of skills, one feature they all share is the capacity to transform into lumbering, hulking incarnations of their normally small frames. By drawing upon the void left behind in their souls, they reflect the anger and cruelty in their minds and physically transform into giant versions of themselves akin to ogres in stature; however, this rage-induced change takes a toll on their bodies. The longer a spriggan remains in giant form, the more pain and agony they have waiting for them when, inevitably, they revert to their true size. Yet this promise of pain does not deter a spriggan from using their power to grow in size, for it’s only when they assume gargantuan proportions that they can truly feel joy and satisfaction. That spriggans feel these emotions only when they are bullying smaller creatures, fighting enemies (or even allies), or inflicting pain on victims speaks to the depths of their corruption.
A spriggan's nature is rooted deeply in its inability to feel joy and pleasure, and as such, non-evil spriggans are rare. Yet they are not unheard of. A spriggan who manages to turn back on their inherent nature loses their ability to assume enormous size, and always becomes a hated (if not feared) exile from their clan. Such a spriggan never fully transforms into a gnome, but those who embrace redemption often discover strange new powers waiting for them to master, such as the ability to draw upon the First World to heal themselves and allies, or the power to transform into actual fey creatures for a short period of time.
As a culture, most spriggans live for battle and constantly patrol their territories in hopes of encountering trespassers to capture and victimize. Even so, spriggans sometimes need to relax. Since they lack the capacity for pleasure, games, art, and similar leisure activities are lost on them. Instead, they fill their idle time training for combat, watching others fight to the death, crafting weapons, or plotting against their kin for personal gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Spriggan Warlord.
While the leaders of larger spriggan enclaves tend to be uniquely trained warriors with highly specialized skills, spriggan warlords are fond of the traditional spriggan weaponry of morningstar and crossbow, valuing this traditional fighting style for its simplicity and for using both weapons to their full potential. Spriggan warlords often serve as sub-commanders in large groups, filling roles in spriggan society akin to captains of the guard or bodyguards to spriggan royalty. In smaller groups or remote outposts, a single spriggan warlord is typically in charge of a band of spriggan bullies.
Love, happiness, and beauty have no meaning for nearly all spriggans, for their minds have long since abandoned the capacity to understand and enjoy such positivity in the world. Violence, malice, and distortion have expanded in spriggan society to fill the aching voids left behind by their ancient expunging of positivity.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Sprite.
Common sprites are primeval guardians that latch onto a person, place, or object and defend it for their own inscrutable reasons. Their dispositions vary from kind to spiteful, but all sprites have a capricious streak. Being only about 9 inches tall, they are wary of animals that might hunt them, particularly house cats, and prefer flight to a fight. On the other hand, sprites are incredibly curious about all forms of magic and heedlessly gather around ley line nexuses or other places of power.
Sprite pranks tend to be kind‑hearted in nature; they might use their abilities to embarrass a braggart or to trick them into a convoluted scheme to help someone notice an admirer who has been there for them all along. Their plans are often half-baked; sprites’ mercurial nature means they can easily become distracted by something new before following through on a previous plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Star Archon.
Embodiments of the virtue of prudence, star archons serve as philosophers and administrators, and in times of war as the tacticians, strategists, and generals of archon armies. Star archons burn with the glory and intensity of a sun, and their sense of duty and desire to defeat evil are as indefatigable as the light of the stars. While their dazzling intellects and unmatched strategic cunning make them most useful in war rooms rather than on battlefields, star archons are fierce opponents when motivated to enter the fray. Those who witness the self-sacrifice of a star archon and live to tell the tale describe the experience in terms that might befit the sight of a supernova at the instant the star collapses in on itself.
Archons live in the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven. They manifest in the Garden at the mountain’s peak from mortal souls who answer a mysterious voice. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms. Intensely orderly in their metamorphosis, new archons begin as lantern archons or other lesser forms, transforming into ever-greater archons as their virtue and achievements grow. Each archon represents a particular virtue, such as hope, charity, justice, or courage, and they gain strength in the presence of mortals who exemplify this virtue. Due to their extremely lawful nature, archons sometimes find themselves at odds with azatas.
While archons do not seek to gather or maintain wealth, they do appreciate beauty and art, and their domains are often decorated with valuable crafts and creative works. Their armor and weapons are similarly ornate, and they always clean and polish their gear after battle. Archons value order—and thus tidiness—in all things.
As with angels and azatas, the most powerful of archons are a caste of demigods known collectively as empyreal lords. Each archon empyreal lord is a unique and powerful creature that keeps a domain somewhere in Heaven and is worshipped on Material Plane worlds. Archon divinities serve a variety of goals and focus on different aspects of righteousness. Some, such as Zohls, hold influence over the pursuit of truth and determined investigations, while others, like Damerrich, the demigod of executions, emphasize the punishment of unrepentant wrongdoers and seek to obliterate evil in all its forms.
When a spirit becomes an archon, they usually start as a lantern archon, the lowliest of archonkind. As they perform noble deeds and bolster their pureness of heart, an archon evolves into greater forms, possibly skipping stages or remaining in others for long spans of time, depending on their particular strengths and personality.
While commonly found in Heaven, archons can also be encountered on the fiendish planes in their endless crusade against evil. On the Material Plane they are usually encountered as advisors or saviors to those in need.
Always ready to defend others, most archons are never encountered out of their suits of armor. Even those who eschew armor, such as the bastion archon, tend to still appear as if they are wearing heavy protection against the scourge of battle.
Archons reside in Heaven, a plane that appears as a single massive mountain. Heaven is broken into seven tiers, with most archons occupying the second level and base of army operations, Proelera, or the sixth level, Iudica, the administrative heart of Heaven.
Many other archons than those presented here patrol Heaven or crusade in the fiendish planes, including the resolute hound archon soldiers and sentinels, and the supreme bastion archons, who rank among Heaven’s most powerful defenders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Steam Mephit.
These brash and arrogant creatures are among the more energetic mephits. They are quick to nominate themselves the leaders of any group, barking out orders in shrill, high-pitched voices and insisting on having everything done their way. Even when they aren't bossing others around, the constant hiss of steam escaping from their pores ensures that there is never a quiet moment.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Mephits are a favorite target for low-level spellcasters to summon, both because they have several useful abilities and because they are relatively easy to command and manipulate. Still, care must be taken when using mephits as minions, because if left unwatched or unattended for too long, they can cause all sorts of mischief.
Different types of mephits that can be found on the same elemental plane often develop friendly (or, in some cases, fierce) rivalries with one another. While mephits from elementally opposed planes (such as fire and water) may have strong opinions about the superiority of their own element, the fact that they rarely see such mephits means that when they do encounter them, they often get along better than they do with their close neighbors.
Perhaps because they're so often compelled into service by mortal conjurers and more powerful elementals, mephits tend to adopt long names peppered with self-proclaimed titles and imagined or exaggerated accomplishments to alleviate their feelings of inadequacy. Some examples of mephit names follow. Anothoraxia, Lurker in Dark Places, the Tragic Hero, One Against AllSilothiscil the Embittered, Rimelord of the Eternal Chill, Lord of IciclesOglophax, Prince of Pungency, the Viscous One, the Forever StainZarnozath the Magnificent, First of His Name, Boiler of Kettles, the Teapot Terror
The four mephits presented here are but the most common of their kind. Others that rise from the mixing of elemental energies exist as well: creatures like dust mephits (who breathe out a scouring cloud of grit), ice mephits (who spit out sickening gusts of frozen air), magma mephits (which can assume the form of a pool of lava), ooze mephits (which spit out foul-smelling acid), salt mephits (who can draw moisture out of the environs and nearby creatures), and steam mephits (which can call down tiny squalls of boiling rain).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Stegosaurus.
The stegosaurus is easily recognized by its twin rows of diamond-shaped dorsal plates that run down its spine, and thick tail adorned with four large spikes. This strange configuration protects this herbivore from predators, as the stegosaurus can hunker down to interpose its dorsal plates between an attacker and its thick body. A stegosaurus defends itself by swinging its spiked tail at larger foes and trampling smaller opponents underfoot.
The stegosaurus often inhabits grasslands, where nutritious vegetation is plentiful and only its dorsal plates rise above waving fields of tall grass. The stegosaurus is among the most curious of dinosaurs, and hunters often find it easy to bait them with shiny trinkets or strange noises. A stegosaurus is about 30 feet long, 16 feet high at the top of its highest dorsal plate, and weighs between 2 and 3 tons.
The stegosaurus is generally more even-tempered and even gentle, despite its size, than the ankylosaurus. This combination makes it even more popular as a trained pet or guard, but even then one should take care to not annoy the dinosaur—an angry or annoyed stegosaurus can lash out with its tail with little warning. Often, it’s wiser to train smaller variants, such as the kentrosaurus. Regardless, their dorsal plates make this dinosaur a poor choice as a mount.
While the real world fossil records hold a wealth of inspiration for the reconstruction of dinosaurs in an RPG, you can also look to living creatures for ideas. Giving a dinosaur a poisonous bite or an unusual attack routine like Clobbering Charge ensures that dinosaurs are as interesting in combat as they are in appearance.
As with most animals, dinosaurs can be tamed or domesticated, but the difficulty of this task increases along with the dinosaur’s level. Lizardfolk and orcs are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, workhorses, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In certain cities, dinosaurs are popularly featured as combatants in blood sports and other gladiatorial battles.
As animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear. Dinosaurs can also be harvested for rare and valuable trophies such as teeth, talons, armor plates, and the like.
At first glance, the inclusion of dinosaurs in a fantasy setting might seem strange, but dinosaurs are an excellent creature to use in a game that bridges the gap between familiar real-world animals and legendary monsters. If having dinosaurs mix freely with lions, manticores, and dragons still seems strange to you, consider having them dwell in remote, primeval lands, as suggested in the sidebars on pages 99–100. On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in the wilder regions of the world, particularly on the continent of Garund, though they are common enough that PCs might find some on display in a menagerie in a northern city, in use as guardian creatures, or even kept by druids as loyal animal companions.
Another classic place that dinosaurs are found in fiction are in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal place to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day‑night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam.
In a fantasy setting, magical effects or supernatural influences can enhance dinosaurs by giving them unexpected attacks, modes of movement, or other abilities. You can quickly create a memorable magical beast simply by giving a dinosaur the magical attack of another creature of an equal level, such as a spinosaurus gaining an acidic breath weapon akin to that of an adult black dragon.
A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or a quick online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well. Armor-headed pachycephalosaurs, spike-thumbed iguanodons, duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed spinosauruses, and more await discovery by those who would seek out the mysteries of the lost worlds where the thunder lizards still rule!
Dinosaurs fit well into certain types of settings. They’re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Stingray.
Found in salt or fresh water, stingrays are normally passive creatures, but when threatened or cornered, they lash out with their tails to lance foes with their toxic stingers. Stingrays often bury themselves in mud, sand, or sea grass, and unfortunately for those wading in shallow waters, stepping on an unseen stingray is a surefire way to receive a painful sting.
Stingrays and manta rays are among the most common species of these fish, but others dwell in more remote areas. The dangerous blood ray is an ambush predator that dwells in murky swamp waters and drains creature's blood after paralyzing them with its sting, while the immense leviathan ray is a deep-ocean predator that has a deadly mouth capable of swallowing small ships whole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Stone Giant.
Stone giants are stoic, reclusive herders and artists who have a rich history and collection of traditions. They dwell in caves in tall mountains and craggy ranges, where their grayish skin allows them to blend in with their surroundings and go unnoticed by imperceptive adventurers. Those benign travelers who come across a tribe of stone giants need not worry much, however, for stone giants do not actively invite confrontation or strife. They are, by and large, a peaceful people who seek wisdom through exploration of nature and long meditations on the elements of the natural world. Their elders are the wisest of stone giants, and use their charisma and druidic magic to lead their tribes to prosperity and harmony with nature.
A typical stone giant stands 12 feet in height and weighs about 1,500 pounds.
Giants often keep an eclectic collection of treasures in their knapsacks or bags. Among these can be found a staggeringly wide range of unexpected and odd treasures and valuables.
As oversized as they are, giants tend to dwell in remote regions of the world, where they have the luxury of claiming larger territories of their own.
As with many people, giants enjoy keeping pets. Yet for giants, what constitutes a pet is often categorized as beast to others. Large animals like bears and lions, and megafauna like woolly mammoths and dinosaurs are popular, as are more magical creatures like hell hounds, manticores, griffons, and the like.
Beyond the giants detailed here, many others dwell in remote regions of the world. Marsh giants are cultists who worship strange sea deities, shadow giants have ties to the Shadow Plane, and mountain giants are horrific butchers even other giants fear.
Giants are larger-than-life foes. While many giants have themes that tie them to elemental or magical forces, the primary theme giants share is that they embody a classic cultural trope as their basis. Fire giants, for example, can be seen as oversized smiths, while hill giants should evoke the flavor of an oversized bully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Stone Golem.
Stone golems are slow and steady constructs typically carved from marble or granite. They’re often made to serve as works of art when at rest, so some golem crafters employ master sculptors to ensure the constructs make beautiful statues. Older stone golems might be weathered, with scuffed or cracked surfaces or missing noses and digits, but this weathering is largely cosmetic and doesn’t adversely impact the golems’ functionality.
Tales tell of particularly immense stone golems residing in certain ancient ruins. Survivors from time-lost civilizations bent on carrying out orders from long-gone masters, these immense stone golems are much more powerful than most stone golems. They are always level 15 or higher and never smaller than Huge in size—most are Gargantuan. Because their size is so great and the structures they dwell in so dilapidated, the awakening of such a stone golem can cause surrounding structures to collapse, ancient foundations to buckle, and ceilings to come crashing down on foes. In addition to the statistics here, these massive stone golems attack with wide, sweeping strikes capable of knocking down multiple targets at once.
Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called “golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.
Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell can affect the golem.
Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.
Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.
Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Stone Mauler.
These towering heaps of earth can inflict tremendous damage up close and from afar.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Earth elementals sometimes have valuable gemstones or minerals incorporated into their bodies, and once they are slain, these valuables can be scavenged as treasure. Gemstones, precious metals such as silver or gold ore, or rarer materials such as mithral or adamantine can be harvested from these creatures, although the more expensive finds tend to be incorporated into only the most powerful earth elementals.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Storm Giant.
Storm giants are looming but benevolent stewards of sea and sky, often serving as the natural guardians of tropical islands, coastlines, or rocky archipelagos. Storm giants tend to rapidly shift in mood and behavior, one moment engaging in peaceful negotiation, the next unleashing unbridled ferocity against their foes. In this way, they embody both the fury of a raging tempest and the calm of a hurricane’s eye. This can make them valuable allies who race to the aid of those in need, but their allies remain must be alert and mindful of their mood, as the giants can be quick to anger or aggressive when caution is most appropriate.
Most storm giants have complexions akin to the crystal blue of the ocean or the warm violet of a sky touched by the setting sun. Their hair tends to be dark purple, blue, or black, and their eyes often have a silvery sheen. A typical storm giant stands 21 feet tall, weighs 12,000 pounds, and lives to be about 600 years old.
Giants often keep an eclectic collection of treasures in their knapsacks or bags. Among these can be found a staggeringly wide range of unexpected and odd treasures and valuables.
As oversized as they are, giants tend to dwell in remote regions of the world, where they have the luxury of claiming larger territories of their own.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Striding Fire.
An embodiment of the speed and chaos of a spreading blaze, a striding fire appears as a lithe and long-limbed humanoid composed of shifting-hued flames churning within a skeleton-like framework.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts.

Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
More than other elementals, fire elementals tend to deviate from neutrality, and are often good, evil, or chaotic in nature. Lawful fire elementals are rare. Fire's inherently capricious nature seems to prevent these creatures from succumbing to the influence of order.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane.

Often, nothing remains after defeating a fire elemental but a pile of ashes and the fading smell of smoke. But sometimes, fragments of their elemental power remain behind. At the GM's discretion, a fire elemental can leave behind ashes, lumps of charcoal, or ever-smoldering cinders that are valuable components for the construction of fire-themed magic items.
Though fire and water classically oppose one another, in the right mixture they can become a dangerous combination. Water elementals heated to a scalding temperature through natural factors such as underwater volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent fire damage with their Strikes, while fire elementals infused with moisture might exude clouds of obscuring or even blinding steam.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Stygira.
Withered hermits wrapped in tattered rags, these scarred, eyeless creatures command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the subterranean depths. In some regions, stygiras are worshipped as seers or even gods, although they lack the ability to grant spells to clerics and are often not aware of their worshippers at all. In other areas, they have strange ties to the ancient empires of the cyclopes, often dwelling in the oversized ruins those creatures left behind long ago. To many stygiras, gemstones harvested from ancient cyclopean mosaics have even greater magical properties than other crystals.
Although technically blind, stygiras do have vestigial eyes hidden beneath the stony, scarred flesh of their faces. Capable of sensing bright lights even through their scars, stygiras are sickened and distracted by these flashing glimpses, so they keep to their caves during the day and wander into the world above only after nightfall. Far from benevolent, they seek out unwary travelers or explorers to capture and reduce them down to the base chemicals and supernatural humors the stygiras require to infuse gemstones with the capacity to give them sight and magical power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Succubus (Lust Demon).
Succubi are manifestations of the sin of destructive lust, and they are the most attractive of all demons—as befits their role in seducing mortals to fall to sin. The concept of gender is fluid to a succubus, as they can adopt countless humanoid forms of any gender to aid in their goals. Most succubi have a feminine true form (incubi, which usually have a masculine true form, are a different kind of demon), but regardless of gender, a lust demon is supernaturally beautiful or handsome, but with curving horns, bat wings, sharp claws, and a sinuous tail.
When disguised as a mortal humanoid on the Material Plane, a succubus whispers into the ears of mortals, urging them to pursue their darkest and most destructive desires and pushing them into depravity, using magic only if persuasion fails. While mortals often fixate on succubi’s application of sexual lust, these demons are can easily exploit lust for power, knowledge, fame, or any other desire as easily as more carnal appetites. Their ability to infiltrate societies makes them excellent spies, assassins, and political saboteurs as well. Ultimately, the succubus enjoys all means of upending mortal culture.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications. For planar ally, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.
The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.
The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.
Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.
When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.
The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.
The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.
While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.
Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Suli.
Because their genie forebears are native to the Material Plane, sulis (scions of mortals and jann) are by and large the most common geniekin on the Material Plane. They are often artisans and peace brokers, compelled to try and bring harmony and balance in a world wrought with discord.
Sulis have a natural charm that often eludes other geniekin, but tend to layer on a level of boastful pride or even arrogance as a personal quirk or humorous facade. Few non-sulis realize that bragging is not simply the symptom of a puffed-up ego for sulis, but instead is a cultural institution easily comparable to human poetry. Sulis' boasts not only glorify themselves, but also secure their companions' and families' accomplishments in history, with the ultimate goal of spinning stories that will be retold for generations. This is especially true for sulis who have lived with other geniekin and have been seen as lesser for not having a strong connection to an Elemental Plane.
Suli dune dancers are but one way these geniekin seek to integrate with other humanoid societies. They work to hone their skills at boasting to an extent that their claims help to bolster those they travel with. Suli from regions other than deserts adjust their names to match their terrains, but regardless of whether they prefer forests, hills, or arctic plains, their boasts remain as compelling.
Many immortals dwell upon the other planes of the Great Beyond. Some are benevolent and kindly, like angels. Others are cruel and destructive, like demons. And some flt roles outside of morality, like psychopomps. It’s far from unheard of that mortals and immortals alike become entangled romantically, and the children of such engagements carry a supernatural element in their bloodlines for generations to follow. After the first generation, this otherworldly influence usually lies dormant, but now and then, the influence can manifest strongly in descendants many years later. These inheritors of extraplanar legacies are known collectively as planar scions.
While most geniekin planar scions live on their genie parent's ancestral plane, rare fonts of elemental power or genie activity sometimes give rise to geniekin on Golarion. By far, geniekin are most commonly found in Katapesh, as genies are more prevalent there than other regions due to the influence of genie binders.
Planar scions from the elemental planes are known as geniekin because they are overwhelmingly born from couplings between mortals and genies: ifrits are born of efreeti, oreads of shaitans, sulis of jann, sylphs of djinn, and undines of marids. Despite this distinguished ancestry, geniekin do not display most of their parents' exceptional talents, such as their ability to grant wishes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sunflower Leshy.
Sunflower leshys are the ambassadors and social leaders of their kind. Their petals radiate from their heads in various hues with a serrated, leafy, beard-like ruff. When particularly excited, their eyes and petals glow with collected sunlight, and when they become depressed or saddened, their usually vibrant coloration grows correspondingly muted. These shifts in coloration are echoed in sunflower leshy art, which can lead to unexpected color palettes for artworks. For example, a human artist might illustrate Hell as a place of glowing lava and flickering flames, drawing upon many vibrant colors, but to a sunflower leshy, the only proper way to depict a place like Hell is in morose grays, blacks, and whites.
The more adventurous sunflower leshys leave their communities to grow bonds with nearby settlements of humanoids. When interacting with humanoids, sunflower leshys are some of the most likely to act friendly and give strangers a chance to prove their good intentions, though they remain cautious. They're often accompanied by other, more powerful leshys.
Because of their relative frailty, leaf leshys frequently act as liaisons and call upon more powerful forest guardians when their domains are threatened. Nymphs, sprites, and other goodly fey may respond to the call of a leaf leshy, as do arboreals and other plant creatures.
When a leshy dies, its body explodes in a wave of vegetation as its spirit returns to the natural world. Though leshy spirits that are called into new bodies after death typically keep only vague recollections of their pasts, they retain many of the values and habits of their former life.
Leshys are fairly egalitarian when interacting with their own kind. Most communities are meritocracies, rewarding leshys who defend their communities and help each other succeed, and they see working together as the best path to a successful future.
Occasionally, a leshy proves so valuable to their community that they're uplifted as a hero. These admired leshys are not all warriors; outstanding artisans, caretakers, or diplomats might also be lauded as heroes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Svartalfar.
Long ago in the mists of history, the fey ancestors of the svartalfars were banished from the First World for crimes too heinous to name. These beings made a new home on the Shadow Plane, which warped their minds and essence and turned them into cold, ruthless killers. Their clans are places of safety but not kindness for svartalfars; they feel no amity toward others, and their actions almost exclusively focus on practicalities.
Svartalfars resemble expressionless elves with pale eyes and gray skin. Many have smooth, bald heads, while others keep their hair short and practical. Svartalfars seem untouched by emotions, especially compassion or mercy. When given a contract, a svartalfar clan seeks its target with grim diligence. Money means next to nothing to them, and attempts to appeal for pity go unheard. A svartalfar clan knows that if they don't end the target's life, another clan will do so, which is a blow to the reputation and standing of the clan that failed.
Svartalfar communities on the Shadow Plane are usually very small, featuring slender towers and extensive underground chambers. Built on or near thin spots between the Shadow Plane and the Material Plane, these communities allow svartalfars easy access to Golarion, where many of their targets reside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Sylph.
Born with elemental gales coursing through their breath, sylphs are wispy planar scions whose bodies seem caught in a perpetual, gentle breeze. Born of unions between mortals and djinn, sylphs are quick-witted and creative, but they are prone to flights of fancy and tend to be easily distracted.
Sylphs are notorious for their practice of “listening to the wind,” which most others dismiss as a fancy name for eavesdropping. Yet this custom means much more to sylphs, who spend hours listening to the stories brought to them on the proverbial breeze. While some less scrupulous sylphs may use the information they learn to blackmail or abuse others, most of them see listening to the wind as their way of staying connected to the world around them while still keeping it comfortably at arm's length. Certainly the typical sylph sneak doesn't seek to use what they learn for ill, but instead tries to warn others of dangers yet unrealized or to prepare themself for a dangerous task.
Many immortals dwell upon the other planes of the Great Beyond. Some are benevolent and kindly, like angels. Others are cruel and destructive, like demons. And some flt roles outside of morality, like psychopomps. It’s far from unheard of that mortals and immortals alike become entangled romantically, and the children of such engagements carry a supernatural element in their bloodlines for generations to follow.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Taiga Giant.
Taiga giants prefer a nomadic lifestyle, both to keep from depleting any one area's resources while satiating their massive appetites and to satisfy a constant wanderlust. They are deeply spiritual and frequently commune with their ancestors' spirits for guidance and knowledge. Taiga giants are happiest when they are left alone to live out their traditional lives, and their impressive size and strength are enough to persuade all but the most dangerous foes to do so.
Taiga giants subsist on migratory herds of aurochs, mammoths, and elk. They occasionally raid humanoid villages, but such cases are opportunistic rather than malicious, with a focus on stealing away livestock for food rather than people. Nevertheless, the arrival of a group of taiga giants is a potentially devastating event to any town or village, so many communities attempt to placate the giants by creating a yearly offering at those times when they know the giants are scheduled to come close.
Most taiga giants venerate their ancestors and seek to honor their works in everything they do. This deep connection makes them ferociously proud of those legacies, and little can compel taiga giants to go to war more swiftly than insulting their ancestors. Merely mentioning the false rumors that ancient taiga giant spellcasters were responsible for the creation of the first rune giants is a surefire way to earn a taiga giant's unending wrath.
A taiga giant stands 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds.
Giants often keep an eclectic collection of treasures in their knapsacks or bags. Among these can be found a staggeringly wide range of unexpected and odd treasures and valuables.
As oversized as they are, giants tend to dwell in remote regions of the world, where they have the luxury of claiming larger territories of their own.
As with many people, giants enjoy keeping pets. Yet for giants, what constitutes a pet is often categorized as beast to others. Large animals like bears and lions, and megafauna like woolly mammoths and dinosaurs are popular, as are more magical creatures like hell hounds, manticores, griffons, and the like.
Beyond the giants detailed here, many others dwell in remote regions of the world. Marsh giants are cultists who worship strange sea deities, shadow giants have ties to the Shadow Plane, and mountain giants are horrific butchers even other giants fear.
Giants are larger-than-life foes. While many giants have themes that tie them to elemental or magical forces, the primary theme giants share is that they embody a classic cultural trope as their basis. Fire giants, for example, can be seen as oversized smiths, while hill giants should evoke the flavor of an oversized bully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Taiga Linnorm.
Taiga linnorms are covered in hundreds of quill-like black spines as sharp as spears. Wise hunters native to linnorm-infested lands know to watch for spines stuck in the bark of conifers—a sure sign that a taiga linnorm has recently passed through. Sometimes this means of tracking isn't enough to avoid an encounter, however; taiga linnorms, like their tarn and tor brethren, are skilled stalkers. They prefer to lurk in half-frozen bogs or swampy marshlands with their heads poking just above the water's surface, ever watchful for unwary prey.
The death curses of the linnorms are often the subjects of tragic sagas, and those who would think themselves vanquishing heroes for slaying a linnorm often meet their dooms soon thereafter, succumbing to these curses well after the death of the linnorm responsible for bestowing it.
Linnorms have a deep connection to the First World, the primordial home of the fey. While linnorms typically won't think twice before devouring a gnome or other fey, they do have an unusual respect for wielders of powerful primal magic. The only way to cow a linnorm, according to common wisdom, is to remind it that there are forces of nature even stronger than itself.
In the storied Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the slaying of a linnorm is traditionally required for those who would claim a nation’s crown. Recently, though, the Linnorm King White Estrid claimed her crown not by slaying a linnorm but by beating it into submission, gaining a powerful and dangerous ally to help secure her rule.
Creatures as powerful as linnorms tend to spawn stories of their own, accurate or not. Critical failure on a check to Recall Knowledge on linnorms might suggest that you can avoid a linnorm's death curse by closing your eyes as you deliver the fatal blow, or that rubbing poison oak on yourself can ward off a linnorm's attention.
As with true dragons, linnorms tend to amass immense piles of treasure in their lairs. These hoards consist of the weapons, gear, and belongings of would-be vanquishers more often than minted coins or works of art.
Almost all linnorms lead solitary lives; they are too reprehensible for even their own kind to tolerate for any length of time. Most species do not even meet to reproduce; rather, female linnorms usually deposit a solitary egg in a remote location, which a wandering male linnorm then fertilizes and places in a nook suitable for incubation. Newborn linnorms range in size from that of adult crocodiles to full-grown bulls, and their growth is rapid. Even a juvenile linnorm is strong enough to wreak havoc on a small settlement— though most don't dare to commit such audacious pillaging, for fear of evoking the anger of another, larger linnorm in the area.
Linnorms exist in a variety of forms beyond the four detailed here. The gaunt cairn linnorm, the spiny taiga linnorm, and the aquatic fjord linnorm each terrorize their own specific regions of the Material Plane.
While the linnorms presented here and in the first Bestiary constitute the majority of these creatures, others exist, particularly in the remote regions of the First World. It may be that these rare linnorms simply find the Material Plane too constraining for their might!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Tallow Ooze.
Pale yellow and smelling of meat, this unnatural, globular monster is composed entirely of rendered animal fat. A tallow ooze typically results from magical mishaps during the creation of enchanted candles or soaps, or while rendering the fat of a magical beast, though occasionally spellcasters create these beings intentionally.
A tallow ooze hunts other creatures to subsume them into its own body and absorb their fat. Since tallow is solid at room temperature, tallow oozes must metabolize their own bodies to produce enough heat to remain gelatinous. A tallow ooze that cannot replenish itself with absorbed fat will either consume itself or solidify, though a tallow ooze exposed to too much heat might melt entirely.
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms are usually found near each other, as the two oozes are part of the same life cycle. When a giant amoeba grows large enough, it can spontaneously split apart into two separate amoeba swarms, and when an amoeba swarm feeds enough, its individual components can fuse together into a single creature.
Many oozes have acidic attacks that can quickly degrade flesh, wood, and even stronger materials. Some believe that oozes are the result of alchemical or magical experimentation run amok, while others postulate that they simply emerged from the natural processes of evolution.
Many varieties of these nearly mindless predators exist in the world. Some are mere variants, with different colored puddings, jellies, and oozes with little to differentiate them from those presented here other than their habitat. Others are more specialized, or even dangerously intelligent. The shoggoth is one such example, but another variety of deadly and powerful ooze is the thankfully rare blight, a creature composed of protoplasm and eyes that curses entire regions with its presence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Tarn Linnorm.
Although more powerful linnorms exist, the multi-headed tarn linnorm can wreak an awe-inspiring amount of devastation.
The death curses of the linnorms are often the subjects of tragic sagas, and those who would think themselves vanquishing heroes for slaying a linnorm often meet their dooms soon thereafter, succumbing to these curses well after the death of the linnorm responsible for bestowing it.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Tarrasque, The Armageddon Engine.
The most powerful spawn is Tarrasque, whose legend spread across countless worlds beyond Golarion. Its destruction of the nation of Ninshabur and its march across Avistan in –632 AR culminated in the destruction of the flying Shory city of Kho before this spawn was sealed away in a remote cavern.
All spawn of Rovagug can sleep for centuries and do not need to eat, drink, or even breathe while hibernating. While hibernating, a spawn’s resistances double in value. It cannot be located by divination effects, and for any saving throw, it uses the outcome for one degree of success better than the result.
A spawn of Rovagug has regeneration powerful enough to revive it even if slain by a death effect. If the spawn fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 Hit Point. It can be banished, imprisoned, or transported away as a means to save a region, or kept in a state of dying by an effect that deals constant damage. A complex and expensive ritual culminating in a word that douses Xotani’s flames can be used to deactivate its regeneration, but no method of deactivating Tarrasque’s regeneration has yet been discovered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Tatzlwyrm.
Tatzlwyrms resemble human-sized snakes with two arms and a dragon's head. Distant relatives of true dragons, tatzlwyrms possess only a meager level of intelligence. They can speak Draconic (with a thick, hissing accent), but their ability to reason is limited and they can't use magic. They do possess a level of cunning, however, and some have been known to build rudimentary traps and even lairs. They are not treasure-hoarders, though, so don't expect to find a tatzlwyrm sitting atop a bed of coins.
Some tatzlwyrms have managed to forge working relationships with dragons, though it's a rare occurrence. From time to time, dragons have used them as messengers (because they can speak their language, however crudely), scouts (due to their smaller size), guides (when they're familiar with a particular mountain), and even muscle (harassing foes not worthy of a dragon's direct attention).
Tatzlwyrms don't work with kobolds, though—tatzlwyrms eat kobolds.
Tatzlwyrms hibernate in cold weather, and when they feel winter approaching they seek out underground lairs, mountain crevices, or even hay lofts. On one notable occasion, townsfolk reported being briefly overrun by tatzlwyrms after a conflict between spellcasters in the nearby hills caused a sudden blizzard. Local scholars still debate whether the cause of the influx was the sudden change in weather or if the creatures were drawn to one of the other magic users staying in town who were part of the same pilgrimage as those doing battle.
When confronted, tatzlwyrms are more likely to attack than retreat. Indeed, they sometimes lie in wait on purpose, taking advantage of their scales' natural camouflage and awaiting the chance to unleash their signature move: belching poisonous vapor into an opponent's face. Since this breath attack doesn't have much range, the wyrms usually need to grab their foes first and bring them close to their mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Tendriculos.
These strange amalgams of plant and fungus with animal tendencies form where the natural world is corrupted by foul magic or frayed planar boundaries. Tendriculoses are instinctive ambush predators who seek out lightly traveled forest paths and lie in wait in the undergrowth. A tendriculos swallows its prey as quickly as possible and lets its paralytic digestive juices finish the meal, while swiftly restoring itself with the nourishment provided by the trapped creature. When collected, neutralized, and refined, the digestive fluids of a tendriculos form a lacquer that retains some of the tendriculos's acid resistance.
A tendriculos comes into being with a rudimentary understanding of the Sylvan language, but in some cases it might manifest knowing a different tongue, such as Aklo, Draconic, or even Necril. Regardless, tendriculoses have little patience for chattering from potential meals, though some determined fey and primal spellcasters have been known to form alliances or even closer bonds with tendriculoses. Befriending a tendriculos requires great patience and plentiful food—and these the gifts of food must be alive when handed over.
When it has finished feeding and is out of combat, a tendriculos slips into a quiescent state for a full day, one of the few times it is safe to approach. Upon rousing, it seeks the deep forest to regurgitate the less digestible portions of its meal. These remains may contain valuables that survived digestion and indicate that a tendriculos's hunting grounds lie nearby.
Tendriculoses dwell in deep woods and jungles. Those too near populated areas soon draw unwanted attention with their ravenous appetites. Well-fed tendriculoses develop fruiting bodies that cast forth millions of spores. Spores that happen to alight on carrion grow into new tendriculoses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Tengu.
Crow-like humanoids, tengus are a canny and clever people who can be found across all of Golarion. Tengus are used to being minorities and facing suspicion wherever they travel, so by necessity many possess a knack for languages as well as for blades. They live on the fringes of society and tend to flock toward less-than-legal occupations, earning them their reputation for being streetwise and unscrupulous—a label that, in turn, perpetuates the tengus’ oppressive cycle of discrimination and illegitimate work.
Although humanoid, tengus have very distinct, birdlike features, and many would say that they resemble crows more than they do humans. They have strong, thick beaks, as well as sharp talons at the ends of their arms and legs. Most of a tengu’s body is covered in small feathers that range in color from dark brown and midnight blue to glossy black, with lighter colors being rare but not unheard of. Like many avian creatures, tengus have hollow bones, making them much lighter than other humanoids of their size, although few tengus possess the wings necessary to fly naturally. A tengu’s speech might be punctuated by quick clucks or throaty cawing, and many tengus practice conversation diligently to rid themselves of these involuntary ticks. Ruf ing of the feathers and compulsive, jerky movements of the neck are other trademark habits. Tengus reproduce by laying eggs: the average tengu egg is about 11 inches in diameter and 16 inches tall and takes 4 months to hatch.
Tengus are a people in diaspora and are almost always found within larger kingdoms and communities of other races. Perhaps because they are more visually distinctive than most other humanoid races, tengus tend to be distrusted and persecuted more often than, for example, elves or dwarves. As a result, tengus tend to gather in close-knit social groups composed of other outcasts and people of uncommon ancestry. Few true tengu communities exist, and those that do are often exiled to ghettos and other forgotten city quarters. From an early age, tengus learn that the world is not a friendly place and that they must look out for themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Tenome.
A tenome resembles an eyeless humanoid with rumpled, pale skin and a single eye embedded in each palm of its cadaverous hands. When they opens their disturbingly wide mouth, this sly, frightful predator's fangs hum and pulse with an eerie drone.
Tenomes prefer to stalk urban environments; they often wear hooded cloaks or flowing robes to obscure their monstrous features, posing as beggars or corpses to blend in with society. When they attack, tenomes approach their victim with their palms outstretched, attempting to trap prey with their terrifying gaze. Once they seize their prey, tenomes vibrate their strange teeth rapidly as they feasts, emulsifying the bones into a digestible ooze that they slurps from a wound. Tenomes can be put at a disadvantage while hunting, as their vision is obscured when they have prey grabbed. Because of this, tenomes either wait for lone victims or hunts in packs. Members of these groups work together to secure meals for the entire pack and protect each other from being ambushed while feeding.
There are rumors that if tenomes pluck the eyes from their victim and places one in each of the corpse's palms, the slain creature will rise as a new tenome the next nightfall. Even tenomes aren't sure of the truth of this rumor, as none remember their own origins, but they might mutilate the corpses of their victims this way in the hopes of creating a pack mate or to instill terror in those who discover the body.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Teraphant.
Though teraphants may resemble an elephant from afar, teraphants lack the long incisors that mark other pachyderms. Instead, tusk-like horns grow from their forehead. Native to Vudra, teraphants are occasionally found in Jalmeray and Nex, brought as rare gifts for nobles.
These placid herbivores' resonant psychic powers warn them against creatures approaching with ill intent. Faced with strong, sustained emotions, teraphants may find themselves responding in kind, which sometimes drive them into a fearsome rage against aggressive foes.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Terotricus.
The legendary terotricus is a massive slime-mold that hails from the Abyss. Its collective consciousness encapsulates entire regions, spreading as far as its ever-growing cloud of spores will take it. Once it has seeped onto the Material Plane from the Abyssal realm, a terotricus’s agenda is to feed on all living creatures, infecting them with its spores, and its presence can spell doom for any in its way.
Terotricuses move by rapidly expanding and contracting their slimy “bodies,” which are capable of burrowing through soil, gliding across water, and scrabbling up steep slopes. These behemoths of rot don’t need to travel to see their plans come to fruition, though; their spores easily latch onto demons and other denizens of the Abyss, who in turn bring this blight to the Material Plane when the fiends are summoned.
When a terotricus infects a creature with its spores, web-like fungal growths start appearing on the victim’s skin until they cover the entire body, at which point the victim’s mind is also subdued and bent to the terotricus’s will. The terotricus’s favored victims include animals, elves, and fey, though it is happy to infect any creature it can catch. Cults of Treerazer occasionally attempt to make contact with a terotricus, but such acts almost always simply result in a new sect of spore-blighted slaves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Thanadaemon (Death Daemon).
Also known as the deacons of death, thanadaemons represent death via old age. They are among the most patient daemons, and prefer to bide their time to enact far-reaching, decades-long plans rather than fight (though they are still deadly foes). Like the Horseman of Death, they ply the waters of the River Styx in search of wayward souls. Rarely are thanadaemons seen without a trademark oar (which they wield as a bo staff), a tool they use to navigate the river's muck-ridden channels and turbulent rapids.
While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals’ fear.
While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane of pure evil for only the most corrupt souls. If Hell is a realm of torture and systematic depravity, Abaddon is its twisted cousin—a place where one can find only misery and despair in ample quantities, with neither the strictures of Hell nor the chaotic freedom of the Abyss. For evildoers who seek simply to inflict their wickedness on others, Abaddon is a rich hunting ground where one can revel in turpitude, though visitors be forewarned: the competition is fierce.
The four Horsemen are the most powerful of the daemonic demigods, but they are only four of many. Far more daemonic harbingers dwell on Abaddon, each a unique and powerful demigod in their own right that enjoys sweeping influence among daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector (ruler of the slave city of Awaiting Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian (consort to the Horseman of Famine), and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame (patron to arsonists and agent of the Horseman of War) are but three of the dozens of harbingers who rule realms in Abaddon.
Each of the four Horsemen is served by a specific category of servitor daemons known as deacons. Leukodaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Pestilence. Meladaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Famine, while thanadaemons serve as deacons to the Horseman of Death. Purrodaemons are currently the most powerful of the deacons, and serve the Horseman of War—yet over time, which category of deacon is the most powerful can wax and wane.
Numerous powerful and unique daemon demigods, known collectively as harbingers, rule over swaths of Abaddon. Above these demigods, though, are entities of even greater power—the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. As the eons go on, the names and identities of specific horsemen change. Currently, they consist of Apollyon (Horseman of Pestilence), Charon (Horseman of Death), Szuriel (Horseman of War), and Trelmarixian (Horseman of Famine). Of these, only Charon has never fallen to an upstart. Some hold that a “Fifth Horseman” once ruled over the other four, while others maintain that the eternally eclipsed sun in the skies above Abaddon is all that remains of this long-dead god.
As many daemons exist as there are awful ways to die. The bloody sangudaemon personifies death by blood loss, while the skeletal thanadaemon represents death from old age. The most powerful daemons are the olethrodaemons, who represent the massive deaths caused by apocalypses and the end of entire worlds.
Daemons often carry soul gems either as trophies or for powering an ability. Cacodaemons are the most common source for soul gems, but they can also be created by spells like bind soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem to power an ability, the trapped soul is released into the afterlife and can be resurrected normally.
Soul gems are traded in illicit markets, a tradition celestials and psychopomps alike find vile. Soul gems' value varies, but is generally worth an amount relative to the level of a gem's captive soul.
Daemons embody a fundamental paradox—while they are incarnations of death and seek to devour all that lives, they are themselves living creatures. Some speak of a glorious end time after which reality will finally be free of the contagion that is life itself. Most daemons give no thought to this paradox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Thanatotic Titan.
Thanatotic titans served as assassins in the war against the deities. They learned to sever their targets' divine connections, murdering mortal priests and divine heralds alike. Thanatotic titans were locked away in the Abyss, but some sneak away from the Abyss to continue their sprees of murder and mayhem.
Titans vary widely, depending on what function the deities intended them to serve or their methods of waging war. They include inflexible davana titans, warmongering hekatonkheires, armored fomorian titans, shapeshifting sashenji titans, and cunning citevi titans.
Some titans carry a fabled mattock of the titans. Good titans use it to build, while evil titans use it to destroy. Similar weapons include the felling axe of the titans, a greataxe that can be whirled to create a punishing winds effect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Theletos.
Theletoses maintain the balance between fate and free will. A theletos is a roughly spherical mass of crystals from which emerge four limbs, each split at the elbow and ending in three-fingered hands. A pair of crystalline tentacles also emerges from its body. Those who have been damaged by a theletos's tentacles describe a disorienting dilemma as they simultaneously feel forced to make a single choice while also being overwhelmed by the endless options available to choose from. Theletoses are more likely than most aeons to interfere in non-aeon societies, particularly in regions with draconian laws. Their involvement is twofold; a theletos concerns itself with both the freedom of individuals and the laws that restrict these individuals, even (or especially) when the two are in opposition.
As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons’ war against imbalance—particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos.
Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the “Convergence.” At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons — but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How—or if—this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves.
Whether the aeons serve an actual divinity, a philosophical concept, or merely a “supreme oneness” is a topic hotly debated by planar scholars. The aeons themselves are silent, referring to this being or concept as the Monad, a “condition of all.” Regardless of what the Monad actually is, there certainly exists another category of powerful aeons—the primal inevitables, each a unique demigod with its own powers and goals. Relatively few primal inevitables remain today, for nearly three-quarters of their irreplaceable kind have fallen in the endless battle with the inexorable forces of entropy.
Aeons are among the least understood of the Great Beyond’s immortal creatures, and they have a wide range of powers and abilities. Far more aeons exist than those presented here, including guardians of time like the four-armed bythos and the weirdly symmetrical theletos, which moderates the duality between freedom and fate.
To mortals, aeons sometimes seem to combine elements that are fundamentally incompatible, whether it's an aeon combining opposing concepts, or axiomites and inevitables mixing the organic with the mathematical or mechanical. Aeons see no paradox in this, but rather claim it is an expression of the underlying unity of all things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a The Stabbing Beast.
The Stabbing Beast, the divine representative of Norgorber, resembles an immense scorpion with a soft and strangely captivating voice. They appear on Golarion to bury secrets, support the faithful, or aid audacious thefts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Thrasfyr.
As bizarre in appearance as they are ferocious, thrasfyrs resemble six-limbed bears with bull-like horns, draconic scales, and a fire-breathing serpent for a tail. Every thrasfyr is wrapped in animated chains psychically linked to the creature's mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Thulgant.
Although they spend most of their time hunting and battling demons for control of the Abyss, thulgants amuse themselves with a variety of diversions, such as maintaining galleries of petrified mortals or building massive, hive-like lairs filled with enslaved minions. Each of these qlippoth is a horrific tangle of limbs, with spiderlike legs, writhing tentacles emerging from the top of its head, and three scorpion-like stingers.
The qlippoth presented here are but a small fraction of the squirming awfulness that lurks in the deeper rifts of the Abyss. Other types of qlippoth include multi-armed, crab-like gongorinans, which use living creatures as incubators; shapeshifting utukku, which infiltrate and undermine religions; death-spawned behimirons, which slay the living to reproduce; and the living siege engines known as catabolignes. Yet most frightening of all is the immense iathavos, a monster so abhorrent that even the Abyss cannot bear to allow more than one to exist at any one time.
Qlippoth ruled the Abyss for eons and still see themselves as its rightful rulers. When the Abyss first began to spawn demons from the souls of sinful humanoids, the realm was plunged into a brutal war spanning untold millennia, in which qlippoth, though more powerful and established, were slowly but surely driven back by the endless demonic hordes who spawned far more quickly than qlippoth could ever hope to match. Today, qlippoth have been driven to the deepest, darkest corners of the Abyss where they cling tightly to the crumbling remains of their territory.
As qlippoth lost territory to their demonic rivals, they realized that the only way to stem the tide of demonic forces was to starve them of the sinful souls that the Abyss uses to spawn new demons. While qlippoth have no concept of how they might go about preventing sin by changing the way mortals act, they do understand that exterminating mortal life would solve the problem as well.
The most powerful qlippoth are quasi-deities themselves, ancient entities only rarely worshipped by non-qlippoth. Of these monstrous divinities, the Polymorph Plague, Yamasoth, is the most well-known. Others include Chavazvug the Crawling Inferno, Isph-Aun-Vuln the Feaster Within, and Thuskchoon the Everglutton.
Although it is widely accepted that qlippoth have lost incalculable territory in the Abyss to demonkind, these fiends still control vast regions in the deepest reaches of that plane. Some sages suggest the troubling possibility that perhaps qlippoth still hold more territory of the Abyss than demons do, but because demons are more concerned with mortal life, we simply interact with the layers they control more often. For all we know, these dour sages postulate, the Abyss teems with endless swarms of qlippoth that have yet to make their move against mortal life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Thunderbird.
Thunderbirds bring storms on their wings. In times of drought, they are welcomed. Other times, they are offered gifts in hopes they might leave before flooding begins. When angered, they call down hurricanes and lay waste to entire villages, so many settlements conduct extensive rites to appease and honor local thunderbirds.
Thunderbird parents carry their newly hatched offspring to hidden mountaintop nests, where the young are struck by their first bolts of lightning and learn the mysteries of the storm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Tick Swarm.
This swarm of thousands of fist-sized ticks forms a moving carpet of bloated insects—a nauseating and intimidating sight.
Giant ticks and tick swarms can potentially inflict diseases other than tick fever. Potential diseases that a tick could spread include blinding sickness, bubonic plague, malaria, or scarlet fever. The saving throw DC should be adjusted to DC 17 (for giant ticks) or DC 27 (for tick swarms).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Tidal Master.
Tidal masters use their power over waves and water to drown their enemies.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Though fire and water classically oppose one another, in the right mixture they can become a dangerous combination. Water elementals heated to a scalding temperature through natural factors such as underwater volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent fire damage with their Strikes, while fire elementals infused with moisture might exude clouds of obscuring or even blinding steam.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Tiefling.
Tieflings are planar scions with fiendish blood. One of the most common types is pitborn, who bear a demonic corruption infesting their mortal bloodline. Some strive to live above their forebear’s fiendish reputation, but many, such as this tiefling adept, simply accept their label and delve fully into evil.
An important distinction exists between planar scions and extraplanar humanoids, such as fetchlings. Fetchlings and other extraplanar humanoids represent true ancestral groups with their own physical and cultural identities and traditions. Planar scions are members of diverse ancestries who share a similar inheritance from extraplanar beings and, with exception of marids, typically integrate into other humanoid societies instead of building their own.
As many types of planar scions exist as planes of existence, and even then there are significant differences between scions depending on the exact nature of their extraplanar forebears. Angelic scions are known as aasimars, fiendish scions are called tieflings, and monitor scions are urobians.
Two other planar scions are the entropy-infused ganzi and their polar opposites, the orderly aphorites, scions of chaos and law respectively.
Most planar scions are the distant descendants of some immortal progenitor far back in the family’s bloodline. Others, however, may be the result of powerful planar energies, magical curses, or even the intervention of a deity or demigod.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Tiger.
Tigers are solitary and territorial hunters, using their striped hides to blend into the forests and jungles they call home and preferring to attack with surprise.
Leopards are exceptionally adaptable, able to survive in any grassland, forest, or jungle, and even the fringes of deserts.
Lions live in grassy plains and savannas, although species adapted for temperate environs that dwell in mountains exist as well. Male mountain lions lack the mane of their somewhat larger grassland-dwelling kin, but are no less dangerous.
While tigers are most common in forests, they also inhabit grasslands and savannas as long as vegetation is dense, and their dens are often found in caves.
Smilodons live in wooded and grassland areas.
While it's common practice to keep a house cat in the home to ward off unwanted rodents, keeping a big cat for a pet is a different matter entirely. Nevertheless, up-and-coming merchant lords, impetuous princes and princesses, and status-obsessed nobles have tried to do just that, often resulting only in terrified house staff and ruined upholstery. Many among the idle rich will gladly pay for the services of an unscrupulous druid or ranger who promises to help them achieve their dreams of an oversized feline friend, but the dire risks of such an endeavor are enough to dissuade even the greediest would-be animal trainers from even attempting the feat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Titan Centipede.
These colossal, solitary centipedes claim vast hunting grounds.
Centipedes take nearly countless forms amid nearly every climate, with specific traits and abilities varying wildly between species. Tangled forests, arid deserts, foul sewers, deep caverns, and abandoned buildings are all common haunts for centipedes, from oversized specimens capable of taking down significant prey alone to carpets of frenzied vermin gathered into a dangerous swarm. Larger and more specialized centipedes than the two presented here exist, such as the sleek giant whiptail centipede or the immense titan centipede.
All centipedes prefer to eat carrion, gathering in numbers around large corpses or battlefields and jealously guarding their troves of flesh from any who would disturb them. Monstrous centipedes are also aggressive hunters and are particularly fond of devouring horses and similar creatures, often snatching a mount right out from under its rider. They are unusually stealthy for creatures of their size, making their swift strikes all the more frightening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Tixitog.
Tixitogs are a species of bizarre aberrations that make their homes in the dens of giant spiders. Immune to poison and able to traverse sticky webs thanks to the thick slime that covers their bodies, tixitogs steal food cocooned in spider lairs and prey on spiders themselves, but they are careful never to kill so many that their food supply runs out. Their favorite meal, however, is the odd adventurer or spelunker who stumbles into their nest.
These strange creatures have oblong bodies coated in a viscous and transparent slime, three large black eyes, and eight thick, multi-jointed limbs, four of which are inverted and point upward, allowing the monster to easily crawl on either the ceiling or floor of narrow caverns and squeeze through narrow spaces. Their jaws appear small and tubular when closed but peel apart and stretch to terrifying proportions when opened, as their dozens of pointed teeth part to reveal a freakishly long tongue.
A tixitog usually hides from the spiders in the lair it has claimed, not out of fear but to keep the spiders from abandoning the lair and moving elsewhere. When a tixitog emerges from the shadows, most spiders flee from it rather than attack, and the tixitog uses this behavior to direct entire swarms of spiders where it pleases. This is typically bad news for bands of adventurers who find themselves within a tixitog’s lair; in the mass hysteria caused by a skittering swarm of spiders headed straight toward them, spelunkers typically fail to notice the more dangerous threat that follows closely behind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Tor Linnorm.
Tor linnorms dwell in the tallest volcanic mountains, either within natural formed caverns or within molten craters. A tor linnorm’s temper can be as hot and destructive as the magma the creature resembles.
The death curses of the linnorms are often the subjects of tragic sagas, and those who would think themselves vanquishing heroes for slaying a linnorm often meet their dooms soon thereafter, succumbing to these curses well after the death of the linnorm responsible for bestowing it.
Linnorms have a deep connection to the First World, the primordial home of the fey. While linnorms typically won't think twice before devouring a gnome or other fey, they do have an unusual respect for wielders of powerful primal magic. The only way to cow a linnorm, according to common wisdom, is to remind it that there are forces of nature even stronger than itself.
In the storied Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the slaying of a linnorm is traditionally required for those who would claim a nation’s crown. Recently, though, the Linnorm King White Estrid claimed her crown not by slaying a linnorm but by beating it into submission, gaining a powerful and dangerous ally to help secure her rule.
Creatures as powerful as linnorms tend to spawn stories of their own, accurate or not. Critical failure on a check to Recall Knowledge on linnorms might suggest that you can avoid a linnorm's death curse by closing your eyes as you deliver the fatal blow, or that rubbing poison oak on yourself can ward off a linnorm's attention.
As with true dragons, linnorms tend to amass immense piles of treasure in their lairs. These hoards consist of the weapons, gear, and belongings of would-be vanquishers more often than minted coins or works of art.
Almost all linnorms lead solitary lives; they are too reprehensible for even their own kind to tolerate for any length of time. Most species do not even meet to reproduce; rather, female linnorms usually deposit a solitary egg in a remote location, which a wandering male linnorm then fertilizes and places in a nook suitable for incubation. Newborn linnorms range in size from that of adult crocodiles to full-grown bulls, and their growth is rapid. Even a juvenile linnorm is strong enough to wreak havoc on a small settlement— though most don't dare to commit such audacious pillaging, for fear of evoking the anger of another, larger linnorm in the area.
Linnorms exist in a variety of forms beyond the four detailed here. The gaunt cairn linnorm, the spiny taiga linnorm, and the aquatic fjord linnorm each terrorize their own specific regions of the Material Plane.
While the linnorms presented here and in the first Bestiary constitute the majority of these creatures, others exist, particularly in the remote regions of the First World. It may be that these rare linnorms simply find the Material Plane too constraining for their might!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Totenmaske.
Spawned by the same unnatural and self-destructive obsessions that drove them when they were alive, totenmaskes are the undead remnants of the most self-indulgent and sinful among us. Though unable to sate their perverse desires, these foul undead can drain the very flesh from their victims so as to wrap themselves in a perverse mockery of life that allows them to pursue their base wants. Totenmaskes' specific longings vary—one might be obsessed with food or drink, while another might be vain and desirous of an attractive form to marvel at in a mirror, while yet another could simply long for the scent of blood. Whatever the sensation the totenmaske seeks, it is always a vice taken to extreme, for this sin is what helped condemn it to unlife in the first place. A totenmaske obsessed with food, for example, might find itself assaulting bakeries or breweries, while a vain totenmaske obsessed with glamor could quickly grow bored of each new look and switch its victims out daily, or even hourly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Treerazer.
Treerazer, the self-styled Lord of the Blasted Tarn, is a powerful demon on the cusp of ascending to the true power of one of the rulers of the Abyss itself—a demon lord. For now, even as a nascent demon lord, Treerazer is a dangerous foe.
Treerazer rarely leaves his swampy realm of Tanglebriar—a large thicket of tainted foliage and rotting detritus just south of Kyonin’s Fierani Forest—but can be encountered anywhere within that toxic mire, often accompanied by a small legion of demons, corrupted fey, and other deadly allies. Certain occult rituals have the power to call him forth from Tanglebriar, granting him the opportunity to directly work his evils beyond the realm to which he has been exiled. Some believe that no eldritch force contains Treerazer and that, were he willing, he could travel Golarion with impunity, spreading the twisted blessings of his touch and the corruption of his presence, yet the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is as cunning and canny as he is deadly, and prefers to work his evils on the world from the safety of his nightmare realm.
Treerazer is worshipped by cultists throughout the Inner Sea region. The majority of these deranged maniacs can be found within or near the expanse of the Tanglebriar, consisting of fungus-corrupted fey, debased elves, or other sinister demon worshippers. Beyond Tanglebriar, his cultists are rarer and tend to be loners or leaders of very small groups. Treerazer’s religious symbol is a bleeding dead tree that’s been split in half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Triceratops.
Triceratopses are muscular quadrupeds with powerful but short legs, thick necks, and heads crowned by a wide, bony frill. Though they bear a large horn on their snout and one on each brow, these dinosaurs are herbivores and use these bony protrusions only to defend themselves from attackers or in dramatic clashes against other triceratopses for grazing territory or mates. Short-tempered and obstinate, triceratopses are unlikely to back down from a fight unless they are hopelessly outmatched, and the creatures are known to fight to the death for no apparent reason beyond stubbornness. Triceratopses often serve as mounts for lizardfolk, orcs, and giants, who ride comfortably behind the dinosaurs’ protective bone frills. A triceratops is 30 feet long and weighs as much as 10 tons.
Triceratopses are surely the most well-known of the dinosaurs known as ceratopids, but many others exist. For example, the smaller styracosauruses have only one horn but several horn-like protrusions on their frills.
While the real world fossil records hold a wealth of inspiration for the reconstruction of dinosaurs in an RPG, you can also look to living creatures for ideas. Giving a dinosaur a poisonous bite or an unusual attack routine like Clobbering Charge ensures that dinosaurs are as interesting in combat as they are in appearance.
As with most animals, dinosaurs can be tamed or domesticated, but the difficulty of this task increases along with the dinosaur’s level. Lizardfolk and orcs are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, workhorses, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In certain cities, dinosaurs are popularly featured as combatants in blood sports and other gladiatorial battles.
As animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear. Dinosaurs can also be harvested for rare and valuable trophies such as teeth, talons, armor plates, and the like.
At first glance, the inclusion of dinosaurs in a fantasy setting might seem strange, but dinosaurs are an excellent creature to use in a game that bridges the gap between familiar real-world animals and legendary monsters. If having dinosaurs mix freely with lions, manticores, and dragons still seems strange to you, consider having them dwell in remote, primeval lands, as suggested in the sidebars on pages 99–100. On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in the wilder regions of the world, particularly on the continent of Garund, though they are common enough that PCs might find some on display in a menagerie in a northern city, in use as guardian creatures, or even kept by druids as loyal animal companions.
Another classic place that dinosaurs are found in fiction are in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal place to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day‑night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam.
In a fantasy setting, magical effects or supernatural influences can enhance dinosaurs by giving them unexpected attacks, modes of movement, or other abilities. You can quickly create a memorable magical beast simply by giving a dinosaur the magical attack of another creature of an equal level, such as a spinosaurus gaining an acidic breath weapon akin to that of an adult black dragon.
A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or a quick online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well. Armor-headed pachycephalosaurs, spike-thumbed iguanodons, duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed spinosauruses, and more await discovery by those who would seek out the mysteries of the lost worlds where the thunder lizards still rule!
Dinosaurs fit well into certain types of settings. They’re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Triton.
While sometimes understandably mistaken for merfolk—both species live underwater and have a blend of features from both humans and fish—tritons have two legs instead of a tail. This gives tritons the ability to operate on land, though they are neither as comfortable nor as skilled above water as below.
The arms and legs of a triton feature fins that assist in swimming, and their entire body is covered in fine scales that range in color from silver to cerulean blue to seaweed green. Their amphibious nature shows in the webbing between the digits of their feet and hands, as well as the fact that they have both gills and a human-shaped nose and mouth. Triton hair grows in wide strands like seagrass, commonly green in shade but in some cases blue or white. Their eyes range in color from sea blue to golden.
Many tritons see themselves as defenders of the deep, dedicating their lives to protecting the inhabitants of the seas from evil creatures and intruders—whether they come from underwater or the surface world. Primary among triton foes are sea devils and alghollthu, both of whom have amphibious forces that tritons have had to fight underwater and on land.
In their quest to fight underwater evil, tritons sometimes ally with dolphins and sea turtles (both of which make excellent mounts), water elemental, and sometimes even sharks and sea serpents. Tritons can summon such allies using a conch shell as a trumpet. When it comes to other intelligent undersea species, however, tritons take pride in their self-sufficiency, rarely trading with other underwater peoples such as merfolk, and even more rarely forming established alliances.
Tritons live in natural-grown villages on the sea floor, forging dwellings out of colorful coral reefs, in rift valleys heated by volcanic activity, and even in underwater canyons— though they avoid settling in extreme depths due to the risk of encountering krakens or worse. They like to decorate their homes with aquatic plants, bioluminescent fish, and attractive trinkets recovered from shipwrecks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Troll.
Common trolls are dim-witted, gangly giants who stalk the fringes of civilization. They rely on their incredible strength to overpower foes with their vicious claws and toothy maws. A troll’s endless hunger drives it to consume all variety of living creatures, and it is their ravenous eating habits that fuel trolls’ legendary regenerative abilities. Trolls stand anywhere from 12 to 16 feet tall, though they prefer to hunch for comfort and to lull foes into a false sense of security.Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager’s stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls’ capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand—a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies.
The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures’ power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll’s vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though—even the smallest scrap of a troll’s flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster’s entire body until nothing remains.
Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such “troll kings” possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well—mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous— but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood.
Particularly devout trolls, called augurs, claim to possess the so‑called “gift of sight,” which they believe was granted them by the demon lord Urxehl. Augurs practice a disturbing method of future‑telling, in which a troll slashes open its own abdomen and pulls out its entrails to interpret the prophecies in its quivering innards. Other cultists prod and agitate their gutted diviner to keep it conscious throughout the gruesome ordeal.
The blood of trolls is a valuable and difficult-to-procure substance of intense interest to alchemists, witches, and doctors the world over. Though initially it is of little interest other than its unnaturally vibrant hue, when processed correctly its applications are numerous. Experiments have produced oils that restore lost limbs, potions that grant the imbiber supernatural strength, and even smoke bombs that cause anyone caught in the haze to fly into an unstoppable rage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Trollhound.
Trollhounds are squat, slavering beasts akin to trolls in canine form. Requiring vast quantities of meat to fuel their regenerative metabolisms, packs of wild trollhounds prowl the foothills of regions where trolls dwell, their voracious hunger driving them to slaughter and consume any prey they encounter. In some regions, trolls breed trollhounds as pets, utilizing the trollhounds' keen sense of smell to aid in the hunt.
Covered in fetid, weeping sores, trollhounds are carriers of a debilitating contagion known as bloodfire fever. Creatures that contract the disease through the bite of a trollhound experience deep internal pain, as if their blood were on fire. Additional symptoms include loss of muscle coordination, pus-filled blisters, and overall lethargy and fatigue. Other than suffering from skin irritation, both trolls and trollhounds are immune to the major effects of the disease.
Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability to regenerate to carry them through. Not even the threat of fire is enough to repel them, as the beasts don't recognize the danger it represents. Nevertheless, fire is one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds; canny hunters know to burn every last remnant of a supposedly slain trollhound, for their regenerative powers are potent indeed.
While trolls themselves have had great success in domesticating, training, and even befriending trollhounds, the same cannot be said for other would-be masters. Whether impeded by constant exposure to trollhounds' diseased slobber, their ravenous hunger that never seems to be fully sated, or simply their foul personality and quick-to-bite temperament, most attempts to use trollhounds in place of more reliable guardians end in pain, misery, and a pack of feral trollhounds escaping into the hinterlands. Left to their own devices, a pack of escaped trollhounds can breed relatively quickly, and it can take less than a year for a small pack to multiply into a significant threat to the countryside. Best to leave the trollhounds to the trolls, as they say!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Troll King.
Some trolls have learned the skills necessary to survive well beyond the typical life expectancy for their kind and rally others to follow their lead. These champions develop a number of talents that make them worthy leaders and potent hunters—namely their abilities to willingly boost the rate of their regeneration and to shake off the acid and fire that would hinder it, not to mention a bestial roar that can send would-be predators scurrying off. Troll kings possess a cunning far beyond their younger kin— they know to keep their allies close, and their enemies even closer. If a troll king so much as suspects that one of its followers is plotting to usurp it, retribution is swift and fatal.Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager’s stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls’ capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Trumpet Archon.
Trumpet archons are messengers, emissaries, and storytellers—embodiments of the virtue of kindness. They use stories and allegories to prevent bloodshed, and among all archons they are the most likely to work together with angels, perhaps leading to the similarities in their forms. When diplomacy is impossible, trumpet archons rally the righteous to battle—one reassuring glance from a trumpet archon is often all it takes to instill a shaken ally with resounding courage once again.
Archons live in the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven. They manifest in the Garden at the mountain’s peak from mortal souls who answer a mysterious voice. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms. Intensely orderly in their metamorphosis, new archons begin as lantern archons or other lesser forms, transforming into ever-greater archons as their virtue and achievements grow. Each archon represents a particular virtue, such as hope, charity, justice, or courage, and they gain strength in the presence of mortals who exemplify this virtue. Due to their extremely lawful nature, archons sometimes find themselves at odds with azatas.
While archons do not seek to gather or maintain wealth, they do appreciate beauty and art, and their domains are often decorated with valuable crafts and creative works. Their armor and weapons are similarly ornate, and they always clean and polish their gear after battle. Archons value order—and thus tidiness—in all things.
As with angels and azatas, the most powerful of archons are a caste of demigods known collectively as empyreal lords. Each archon empyreal lord is a unique and powerful creature that keeps a domain somewhere in Heaven and is worshipped on Material Plane worlds. Archon divinities serve a variety of goals and focus on different aspects of righteousness. Some, such as Zohls, hold influence over the pursuit of truth and determined investigations, while others, like Damerrich, the demigod of executions, emphasize the punishment of unrepentant wrongdoers and seek to obliterate evil in all its forms.
When a spirit becomes an archon, they usually start as a lantern archon, the lowliest of archonkind. As they perform noble deeds and bolster their pureness of heart, an archon evolves into greater forms, possibly skipping stages or remaining in others for long spans of time, depending on their particular strengths and personality.
While commonly found in Heaven, archons can also be encountered on the fiendish planes in their endless crusade against evil. On the Material Plane they are usually encountered as advisors or saviors to those in need.
Always ready to defend others, most archons are never encountered out of their suits of armor. Even those who eschew armor, such as the bastion archon, tend to still appear as if they are wearing heavy protection against the scourge of battle.
Archons reside in Heaven, a plane that appears as a single massive mountain. Heaven is broken into seven tiers, with most archons occupying the second level and base of army operations, Proelera, or the sixth level, Iudica, the administrative heart of Heaven.
Many other archons than those presented here patrol Heaven or crusade in the fiendish planes, including the resolute hound archon soldiers and sentinels, and the supreme bastion archons, who rank among Heaven’s most powerful defenders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Twigjack.
Maladjusted forest denizens, twigjacks form from the cruel and prankish combination of fey and the very woods in which they reside. A twigjack's body is made up of prickly brambles woven with vines. Shaggy, mossy growth, not unlike hair, tops a twigjack's head. Its mouth is just a canyon of splintered and broken sticks bisecting its face. Leaves and sprigs of new growth randomly sprout from the creature's body. Many dense forests on Golarion have at least a handful of twigjacks living in the undergrowth.
While truculent and violent, twigjacks care deeply for what they consider to be their forests. These creatures harass outsiders who delve deep into their wooded domains, forcing back even the most determined explorers, foresters, and travelers, especially when those intruders cut roads through the forest. However, they are not terribly territorial when it comes to other forest creatures. When sylvan creatures, especially fey, rally against an outside threat, twigjacks in the area eagerly arrive to fight, even if they were not invited.
Less seasoned travelers who encounter twigjacks in their canopied homes often mistake them for leshys, a tendency that frustrates twigjacks, as they have a low opinion of such creatures. More broadly, twigjacks resent being considered mere animated plants at all. Rather, they embrace their fey heritage—often to a foolish end. Twigjacks go out of their way to ingratiate themselves to the fey creatures they live among. Several popular comic songs weave the tale of a twigjack attempting to woo a powerful and graceful dryad, only to be comically disgraced after many loutish attempts. Many fey seem embarrassed by these strange cousins, but some spriggans, quicklings, and redcaps harness the twigjacks' violent urges and disruptive behavior for their own purposes.
While twigjacks are fey, and as such are often found in the First World, it's somewhat curious that those twigjacks who find religion only rarely turn to the Eldest of the First World. Instead, twigjacks tend to worship false deities of their own design: figures spotted in tangles of tree branches, clots of undergrowth, or other hidden nooks in the natural world. These religions are always highly localized, and while these faiths do not support clerics, they often inspire zealous crusades against non-fey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Two-Headed Troll.
Two-headed trolls are savage, dual-minded monsters with an unquenchable thirst for bloodshed, and dread tales of their ravenous appetites are whispered of in homesteads throughout the lands of the Inner Sea. Indeed, it is a custom for parents to invoke the two-headed troll as a warning to misbehaving children. “Finish your chores,” a parent might say to a stubborn child, “or a two-headed troll will snatch you away at night and swallow you whole!” It's unclear why such a morbid tradition gained traction with parents, but it's an undeniable fact that two-headed trolls have an appetite for “nibbles”—creatures small enough to devour with one bite.
Mature two-headed trolls stand 13 feet in height, weighing roughly 1,700 pounds. Unlike common trolls, two-headed trolls share the upright gait of their ettin ancestry and do not walk hunched over.Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager’s stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls’ capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand—a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies.
The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures’ power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll’s vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though—even the smallest scrap of a troll’s flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster’s entire body until nothing remains.
Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such “troll kings” possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well—mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous— but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood.
Particularly devout trolls, called augurs, claim to possess the so‑called “gift of sight,” which they believe was granted them by the demon lord Urxehl. Augurs practice a disturbing method of future‑telling, in which a troll slashes open its own abdomen and pulls out its entrails to interpret the prophecies in its quivering innards. Other cultists prod and agitate their gutted diviner to keep it conscious throughout the gruesome ordeal.
The blood of trolls is a valuable and difficult-to-procure substance of intense interest to alchemists, witches, and doctors the world over. Though initially it is of little interest other than its unnaturally vibrant hue, when processed correctly its applications are numerous. Experiments have produced oils that restore lost limbs, potions that grant the imbiber supernatural strength, and even smoke bombs that cause anyone caught in the haze to fly into an unstoppable rage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Tyrannosaurus.
Widely regarded as the king of the dinosaurs, the tyrannosaurus is a massive predator with a wide mouth filled with viciously sharp teeth. Thundering beasts of fury and hunger, tyrannosauruses are bold and fearless carnivores that eagerly bite off great hunks of large prey and swallow smaller prey—such as most humanoids—in a single gulp. Although they can subsist on carrion, tyrannosaurs prefer live prey.
Tyrannosauruses stand on two wide, powerful hind legs that allow them to run quickly, and their thick tails provide them with exceptional balance. Although a their small forelimbs are of little use other than to hold prey in place while the predators tear at their victim’s flesh with their fearsome jaws, even these forelimbs bear sharp claws several inches long. As fearsome as tyrannosauruses are alone, they sometimes hunt in packs to take down massive prey. Only the most powerful creatures can successfully train tyrannosauruses, and even then, only when they can provide the ravenous beasts with a steady diet of meat.
Some tribes of giants, particularly cyclopes or more obscure denizens of primeval lands, have even trained tyrannosauruses as mounts or beasts of war. In other places, xulgaths feed these prisoners to these mighty dinosaurs as part of executions or ritual sacrifices. Some xulgath cults even revere tyrannosaurs as incarnations of their violent demonic demigods. For their part, tyrannosaurs who have grown used to having their meals provided in this manner are remarkably well-behaved toward their feeders and keepers. Tyrannosauruses are 50 feet long and weigh 7 tons or more.
While the real world fossil records hold a wealth of inspiration for the reconstruction of dinosaurs in an RPG, you can also look to living creatures for ideas. Giving a dinosaur a poisonous bite or an unusual attack routine like Clobbering Charge ensures that dinosaurs are as interesting in combat as they are in appearance.
As with most animals, dinosaurs can be tamed or domesticated, but the difficulty of this task increases along with the dinosaur’s level. Lizardfolk and orcs are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, workhorses, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In certain cities, dinosaurs are popularly featured as combatants in blood sports and other gladiatorial battles.
As animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear. Dinosaurs can also be harvested for rare and valuable trophies such as teeth, talons, armor plates, and the like.
At first glance, the inclusion of dinosaurs in a fantasy setting might seem strange, but dinosaurs are an excellent creature to use in a game that bridges the gap between familiar real-world animals and legendary monsters. If having dinosaurs mix freely with lions, manticores, and dragons still seems strange to you, consider having them dwell in remote, primeval lands, as suggested in the sidebars on pages 99–100. On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in the wilder regions of the world, particularly on the continent of Garund, though they are common enough that PCs might find some on display in a menagerie in a northern city, in use as guardian creatures, or even kept by druids as loyal animal companions.
Another classic place that dinosaurs are found in fiction are in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal place to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day‑night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam.
In a fantasy setting, magical effects or supernatural influences can enhance dinosaurs by giving them unexpected attacks, modes of movement, or other abilities. You can quickly create a memorable magical beast simply by giving a dinosaur the magical attack of another creature of an equal level, such as a spinosaurus gaining an acidic breath weapon akin to that of an adult black dragon.
A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or a quick online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well. Armor-headed pachycephalosaurs, spike-thumbed iguanodons, duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed spinosauruses, and more await discovery by those who would seek out the mysteries of the lost worlds where the thunder lizards still rule!
Dinosaurs fit well into certain types of settings. They’re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Tzitzimitl.
Due to their affinity for darkness and apocalyptic terror, tzitzimitls are widely feared as harbingers of death and destruction. Some sages consider them to be instruments of the gods, called down to destroy worlds whose times have come, while others believe that tzitzimitls are exiles from a far-off civilization of spacefaring giants. The truth of their nature is likely even more disturbing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Umonlee.
Those who dwell in the coldest climates of Golarion tell of a brutal beast that swims through the ice and snow and can devastate entire villages in minutes. Ancient Erutaki who made their homes in the frozen polar expanse called the Crown of the World named this monster the umonlee.
Umonlees are bestial predators who constantly hunt, rarely resting in service of a hunger that is never fully sated. Despite this animalistic drive, umonlees are semi-intelligent creatures who often select and stalk their prey. However, they are not terribly bright and often keep their hunting grounds in sparsely-trafficked areas. It is rare for an umonlee to attack a village, but one might attack a sparse group, such as a hunting or scouting party. Many caravans traversing the Path of Aganhei—the trade route between the continents of Avistan and Tian Xia that crosses the Crown of the World—have had their expeditions abruptly ended by an encounter with one of these monstrosities.
Those who study monsters posit that umonlees are related to chuuls, as the creatures exhibit some similarities. Both are semi-intelligent, crustacean predators that use ambush tactics to kill and eat their prey. Even though they can talk, umonlees typically only speak Aklo, which also gives credence to this theory. This would also lend to the theory that chuuls are products of alghollthu manipulation, meaning that umonlees are also the results of these alien designs. However, the fact that these creatures aren't evil argues well against such a theory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Undine.
Undines are infused with elemental water—the churning power of the briny deep flows through them. These planar scions are often athletic and lithe, but they are easily distracted by auditory sensations because of how much louder and clearer sound rings above the waves.
Undines are perhaps the most settled of all geniekin, often forming communities along the coast or even on the water itself. In the latter case, they prefer to settle in ship-towns that sometimes number dozens of vessels in all shapes and sizes. The undines who fill these communities are similarly diverse, bringing aspects of multiple cultures together to form one whole. Ship-towns are permanent, but fluid—they grow, recede, and migrate constantly as undine families add their ships to or remove them from the flotilla. An undine town like this may remain at sea for years, its residents coming ashore only on rare occasions to collect wood for cookfires or to repair their homes. The paradoxically ever-shifting permanence of these communities reflects the undine virtues of adaptability and freedom, while also maintaining the prime importance of the community.
Undine hydromancers are quite valued on these floating settlements, if only for their ability to create fresh drinking water while adrift on the sea.
Many immortals dwell upon the other planes of the Great Beyond. Some are benevolent and kindly, like angels. Others are cruel and destructive, like demons. And some flt roles outside of morality, like psychopomps. It’s far from unheard of that mortals and immortals alike become entangled romantically, and the children of such engagements carry a supernatural element in their bloodlines for generations to follow. After the first generation, this otherworldly influence usually lies dormant, but now and then, the influence can manifest strongly in descendants many years later. These inheritors of extraplanar legacies are known collectively as planar scions.
While most geniekin planar scions live on their genie parent's ancestral plane, rare fonts of elemental power or genie activity sometimes give rise to geniekin on Golarion. By far, geniekin are most commonly found in Katapesh, as genies are more prevalent there than other regions due to the influence of genie binders.
Planar scions from the elemental planes are known as geniekin because they are overwhelmingly born from couplings between mortals and genies: ifrits are born of efreeti, oreads of shaitans, sulis of jann, sylphs of djinn, and undines of marids. Despite this distinguished ancestry, geniekin do not display most of their parents' exceptional talents, such as their ability to grant wishes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Unicorn.
Symbols of grace and purity, unicorns resemble proud and noble horses. They are typically pure white of coat, but they are best known for the single, delicate horn that extends from the center of their forehead. While unicorns often serve as protectors of unspoiled wilderness and sacred places, they are themselves highly sought after for their horns, which are said to possess potent magical properties. To many, the mere idea of hunting such a magnificent creature in the hopes of severing its horn is utterly reprehensible. Indeed, a de-horned unicorn is a sorry sight, and few such unicorns survive much longer in the wild.
Unicorns are found almost exclusively in remote, unsullied areas of wilderness. Sometimes associated with good-aligned deities, other times associated with nature and the fey, unicorns are always known for their righteousness and nobility. They are wary, at best, of most humanoid creatures, due in large part for poachers’ tendency to hunt them for their horns, but unicorns are often rumored to have a weakness for those who are pure of both heart and spirit. Despite some tales, unicorns are equally likely to recognize purity in young men as in young women.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Describe a Urdefhan Dominator.
Urdefhan dominators control the minds of others to glean useful secrets and gain an advantage against their enemies.
While urdefhans are humanoid and dwell together in large groups, this is where their similarities to surface ancestries end. Their visages are horrific, with transparent skin and musculature displaying their glistening entrails, gleaming bones, and perhaps worst of all, their baleful red eyes. This, combined with their gaping maws full of sharp fangs, works to create the false impression that these beings are some sort of vampiric undead, not creatures of living flesh and blood. When an urdefhan’s life comes to an end, their flesh quickly curdles and then bursts in a wave of awful corruption that spreads to the flesh of other creatures in the area. The typical urdefhan views their eventual demise as a disappointment, for once they’re dead, their chances to kill will finally come to an end.
Urdefhans’ primary concern is death and how to inflict it in the goriest, most painful, and widespread ways. Beyond this ethos of violence, urdefhans concern themselves only tangentially with matters such as formal modes of warfare or aspects of their damnable religion. When an urdefhan is not actively engaged in violence, their giddy cruelty is tempered only by a sense of self-preservation that ensures they survive long enough to spread the “blessings” of their daemonic patrons. They pass the time between wars inventing new weapons, developing new diseases, and researching awful new magic, all in preparation for the next inevitable conflict.
Urdefhans use skavelings as mounts most of the time, but they aren't picky, using any beast that can be broken and trained. Giant lizards, pterosaurs, and even Darklands-dwelling manticores all serve as urdefhan mounts, on occasion.
The first urdefhans were unleashed into the depths of Golarion's Darklands in the vault of Minos- Pashat, a nation-sized cavern riddled with maze-like tangles of stalactites, stalagmites, and fissures.
The rhoka sword is the preferred weapon of urdefhan soldiers, though all urdefhans know how to wield these instruments of war. These uncommon advanced weapons cost 4 gp, deal 1d8 slashing damage, have 2 Bulk, and require 1 hand to use. Rhoka swords are in the sword group and have the deadly d8 and two-hand 1d10 traits.<|endoftext|>

Urdefhan spellcasters with a knack for the divine are invariably unholy worshippers of daemonkind, typically taking on one of Abaddon's Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as their patron deity.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Uthul.
An uthul most often appears to be a dark, swirling cloud filled with flying debris and streaked with sudden flashes of lightning. Although they are clearly elemental in nature, uthuls are nearly always found on the Material Plane, where they hide among natural cloud formations, especially thunderstorms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Vampire Bat Swarm.
Although the typical vampire bat has a wingspan of 7 inches and doesn’t pose a significant threat to larger prey alone (and indeed, these blood-drinkers can feed without their sleeping victims ever noticing), some unusually aggressive species of these bats hunt in deadly swarms. A churning cloud of vampire bats is much more dangerous than the sum of its individual parts and is capable of inflicting an overwhelming number of bleeding wounds in a frighteningly short span of time.
Vampire bat swarms roost in colonies wherever they can find shelter from weather, light, and predators, favoring caves, trees, and narrow gorges. Giant bats prefer to dwell in smaller numbers in deep caves, abandoned mines, or the attics of abandoned buildings. Even larger species dwell in the deeper regions of the Darklands, where they are often used as mounts, or even ritualistically slaughtered and then animated as specialized undead guardians of eerie underground cities and nations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Vampire Count.
Vampire counts rule their demesnes through a mix of fear and cruelty.
You can turn an existing living creature into a vampire using the following steps.
Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually becomes evil. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce HP by the amount listed on the table. The vampire gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except silver) as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the vampire has less HP.Starting LevelHP DecreaseFast Healing/Resistance 3–4–205 5–7–307 8–14–4010 15+–6015
All vampires gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme.

Coffin Restoration (divine, necromancy, negative) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls unconscious. If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally.
Vampire Weaknesses All vampires possess the following weaknesses.Compulsions Vampires are creatures of strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion (see below). Revulsion A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the fleeing condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). Stake A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed. Sunlight If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes slowed 1. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors.Climb Speed Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed. Claws If the creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage. Drink Blood (divine, necromancy); Requirement A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. Effect The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes. Grab The creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain Grab.
Powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 5 is not a significant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular vampire spawn, or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire.
Resistances The vampire resists all physical damage except magical silver.
Create Spawn (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.
Mist Escape Trigger The vampire is reduced to 0 HP. Effect The vampire uses Turn to Mist. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. It automatically returns to its corporeal form, unconscious, if it reaches its coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.
Change Shape (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The vampire transforms into one of its animal forms or back into its normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines.
• Bat The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. It gains echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as its highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws, but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage.
Children of the Night (divine, enchantment, mental) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves, but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.
Dominate (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.
Drink Blood As a typical vampire, but the victim is drained 2 instead of 1.
Turn to Mist (concentrate, divine, transmutation) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the gaseous form spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.
Because vampires can inflict their nature upon any creature whose blood they drink, practically any living monster can become one of these undead horrors. When you need to create a vampire for your game, you can do so in two ways. In most cases, it’s more effective to build the vampire from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the vampire count, vampire spawn, and vampire mastermind presented on these pages were built). Or you can use the guidelines presented under Creating a Vampire to turn an existing creature (or even a player character!) into a vampire, adjusting the monster as you see fit. In either case, specific vampire abilities like coffin restoration, Mist Escape, and Drink Blood work the same.
Non-evil vampires are rare and at odds with their basic nature. Such vampires typically give up a fraction of their power in exchange for some of their lost humanity.
The most common and traditional vampires, as presented here, are known also as the “moroi.” They are prevalent in Golarion in the mist-shrouded counties of Ustalav and found in small numbers in almost every nation of the Inner Sea. Other types of vampires include the withered nosferatu, the hopping jiang shi, and the psychic vetala—these vampires share many of the basic traits with moroi but possess new abilities of their own. Dhampir can be born of any of these vampire races, though moroi-born dhampir known as svetochers are the most common, especially in the Inner Sea region.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Vampire Mastermind.
Vampire masterminds are evil wizards who control entire cabals of the undead and instill fear in the hearts of mortals far and wide.
You can turn an existing living creature into a vampire using the following steps.
Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually becomes evil. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce HP by the amount listed on the table. The vampire gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except silver) as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the vampire has less HP.Starting LevelHP DecreaseFast Healing/Resistance 3–4–205 5–7–307 8–14–4010 15+–6015
All vampires gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Vampire Squid.
Vampire squid are neither undead nor blood drinkers. Their name is instead inspired by their red eyes and the dark, cloak-like webbing between their arms. Living in the lightless depths of the ocean, the vampire squid can eject a cloud of bioluminescent mucus that nauseates predators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Vampiric Mist.
Though they're often mistaken for vampires in gaseous form or an unusual type of air elemental, vampiric mists are in fact strange aberrant life-forms. With an amorphous body that consists as much of fluid as it does of air, these creatures dwell in swamps or moist underground regions where their vulnerability to heat isn't as much of a concern. Still, they prefer to lair near the fringes of such areas, as a vampiric mist needs a constant supply of fresh blood for sustenance. While blood drawn from animals is just as nutritious as blood from anything else, these sadistic monsters vastly prefer the flavor of blood drawn from thinking creatures. Like will-o'-wisps, vampiric mists find that fear flavors the blood, though they gain no particular advantage by feeding on the frightened.
Although somewhat intelligent, vampiric mists do not form societies. They sometimes group into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working together. Vampiric mists spend most of their time seeking prey—a pursuit they approach with great creativity. The mists' propensity for taking on vague, skeletal forms of the creatures whose blood they drink further adds to their mystique and fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many vampiric mists enjoy using this common misconception to their advantage, leading foes to apply foolish tactics—such as tricking spellcasters into attempting to use positive energy against them as if they were undead monsters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Vanth.
Protecting the Boneyard are the stern and resolute guardians of the dead known as vanths, psychopomps who resemble skeletons with raven-like wings and a mask resembling a vulture's skull. Vanths carry black scythes to fight against those who would disturb the natural progression of souls, and they consider any visitor to the Boneyard a potential troublemaker. When the psychopomp armies go to war, vanths serve as front-line soldiers. They rarely speak and even more rarely show any emotion other than a grim adherence to duty.
Nosois and morrignas are far from the only of their kind. Many others, like the skeletal vanths or the draconic yamarajes, also aid in the stewardship of the dead.
Psychopomps rarely oppose celestials or fiends. In fact, they frequently host such creatures in the Boneyard, particularly in the sprawling psychopomp courts where these outsiders petition for one soul or another to be remanded to their jurisdiction. Complicated cases are judged by yamarajes, while the thorniest or most politically delicate are handed by Pharasma herself.
Psychopomps' greatest enemies are creatures that devour or steal souls, such as astradaemons and night hags. Their other opponents include necromancers, proteans, and those who have unnaturally extended their lifespan, such as liches.
Some psychopomps view their task of sorting souls as ultimately hollow and meaningless, since the multiverse itself must one day end. Eons ago, these rebels shirked their duties and fled to the empty corners of the planes, becoming a new type of evil creature called a sahkil. Sahkils feed on mortal fears, particularly fears of death, and enjoy tormenting those who must die. Psychopomps generally leave these malcontents alone, except when sahkils interfere with the proper flow of souls.
The most powerful of the psychopomps are unique demigods known collectively as “ushers,” each of whom has its own cult. These psychopomp divinities include Atropos, the Last Sister; Barzahk, the Passage; Ceyanan, the Shepherd; Dammar, the Denied; Imot, the Symbol of Doom; Mother Vulture, the Flesheater; Mrtyu, Death's Consort; Narakas, the Cleansing Sentence; the Pale Horse; Phlegyas, Consoler of Atheists; Saloc, Minder of Immortals; Teshallas, the Primordial Poison; and Vale, the Court of the Ancestors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Vaspercham.
The darkly intelligent vaspercham, an aquatic horror who delights in violence and destruction, lurks in the shallows near shorelines. Once a vaspercham settles on a new home, they stubbornly stay there, regardless of any communities dwelling nearby. A vaspercham's physical might and magic-warping abilities make them incredibly hard to dislodge once entrenched, and many seaside communities have relocated after a vaspercham came calling. The monster responds only to strength, so one must best a vaspercham in combat to gain their begrudging cooperation. But once the creature recovers their strength, they inevitably betray any temporary alliance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Vaultbreaker Ooze.
Though many oozes hunt among the dreary confines of underground caverns, dungeons, and abandoned ruins, others seek to quell their hunger in areas well-trafficked by civilized creatures. The aptly named vaultbreaker oozes exhibit a mindless compulsion to feed on and digest precious metals. When near precious metals, the ichor exuded from their metallic plasm tarnishes black and forms small, jagged crystals that dot the oozes' surface. Like a strange biological compass, these crystals point vaultbreaker oozes to their next meal.
Though mindless, these strange oozes exhibit an innate instinct for picking and bypassing locks to reach their meals by inserting a gelatinous pseudopod into a keyhole and then hardening the appendage into solid metal, forming a tool similar to a skeleton key.
Vaultbreaker oozes can often be found in cities where tectonic instability has created fissures and cracks, allowing them to infiltrate basements, vaults, and underground chambers that may contain treasure. When rumors of vaultbreaker ooze sightings surface, banker consortiums, Abadaran priests, and even local thieves guilds offer hefty sums to have the dangerous oozes destroyed—though some might instead offer a bounty for their capture.
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms are usually found near each other, as the two oozes are part of the same life cycle. When a giant amoeba grows large enough, it can spontaneously split apart into two separate amoeba swarms, and when an amoeba swarm feeds enough, its individual components can fuse together into a single creature.
Many oozes have acidic attacks that can quickly degrade flesh, wood, and even stronger materials. Some believe that oozes are the result of alchemical or magical experimentation run amok, while others postulate that they simply emerged from the natural processes of evolution.
Many varieties of these nearly mindless predators exist in the world. Some are mere variants, with different colored puddings, jellies, and oozes with little to differentiate them from those presented here other than their habitat. Others are more specialized, or even dangerously intelligent. The shoggoth is one such example, but another variety of deadly and powerful ooze is the thankfully rare blight, a creature composed of protoplasm and eyes that curses entire regions with its presence.<|endoftext|>

Juggernauts of destruction, vavakias are formed from the souls of mortals who extract, enslave, or consume the souls of others.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications. For planar ally, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.
The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.
The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.
Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.
When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.
The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.
The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.
While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.
Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Vazgorlu.
The arthropod monstrosity known as a vazgorlu makes its home on the Astral Plane or inside of a stable portal, ambushing creatures that travel there using dimensional magic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Veiled Master (Vidileth).
The powerful vidileths are the insidious veiled masters of the alghollthus. These manipulators of mind and body alike lead their species in the open, using their ability to change form to walk among and deceive humans and other sapient species. Many veiled masters are even more powerful than the typical specimen presented here and can use a wide range of arcane or occult spells and rituals. While veiled masters command significant combat prowess and impressive magical skills, the greatest danger they pose to others is their uncanny ability to infiltrate into societies much different than their own. The most paranoid of adventurers and conspiracy scholars worry that every major city has been infested by secret cabals of vidileths, while others dismiss this as hogwash and fearmongering. The truth is likely somewhere in between, but it doesn’t take many veiled masters pulling the strings behind the scenes to wreak havoc upon an entire nation!
In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave societies and sought to wipe the slate clean—both starting anew and punishing those who had become too willful and rebellious. They used incredible magical power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they’d manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew strong once again—this time without alghollthu influence.
Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a frightening possibility—that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the surface once again.
The ruling castes of the alghollthu species dwell in oceanic depths or underground waterways, while their servitors like ulat-kinis and ugothols can often be found in coastal regions and marshes.
Although most alghollthus lack the greed that tempts most mortals, they do gather wealth and magical tools to use in their schemes. A given aboleth or veiled master might also wear magical jewelry and other objects. Faceless stalkers and other humanoid servants of alghollthus use weapons and armor, such as the faceless stalker’s sword or ulat-kini’s trident, as well as other tools. These servitor races can be as acquisitive as other humanoids.
While the veiled masters are the rulers of alghollthu society, they are not the most powerful of their kind. Greater, more mysterious creatures that function as organic thought networks, immense aquatic engines of war, or specialized extractors of forgotten secrets dwell among their sunken cities. Meanwhile, the world above remains infested with creatures that were originally created by the alghollthus but have long since drifted away from their aquatic progenitors to become their own sinister monstrosities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Velociraptor.
A smaller cousin of the deinonychus, the velociraptor is a swift, cunning pack hunter. It has no fear of larger creatures, and a group of these dinosaurs won’t hesitate to attack creatures the size of a horse. Velociraptors are social animals, and tend to live in groups of up to a dozen other velociraptors. They have manes of feathery plumage that extend down their backs and along the sides of their arms, legs, and tail, while their underbellies and flanks are scaly. These feathers allow them to blend into their natural terrains with ease, but when excited, attempting to intimidate, or seeking a mate, a velociraptor can puff and frill this plumage to expose much brighter colors normally covered by the longer feathers. A typical velociraptor is 1-1/2 feet tall, 7 feet long, and weighs 35 pounds.
While the real world fossil records hold a wealth of inspiration for the reconstruction of dinosaurs in an RPG, you can also look to living creatures for ideas. Giving a dinosaur a poisonous bite or an unusual attack routine like Clobbering Charge ensures that dinosaurs are as interesting in combat as they are in appearance.
As with most animals, dinosaurs can be tamed or domesticated, but the difficulty of this task increases along with the dinosaur’s level. Lizardfolk and orcs are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, workhorses, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In certain cities, dinosaurs are popularly featured as combatants in blood sports and other gladiatorial battles.
As animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear. Dinosaurs can also be harvested for rare and valuable trophies such as teeth, talons, armor plates, and the like.
At first glance, the inclusion of dinosaurs in a fantasy setting might seem strange, but dinosaurs are an excellent creature to use in a game that bridges the gap between familiar real-world animals and legendary monsters. If having dinosaurs mix freely with lions, manticores, and dragons still seems strange to you, consider having them dwell in remote, primeval lands, as suggested in the sidebars on pages 99–100. On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in the wilder regions of the world, particularly on the continent of Garund, though they are common enough that PCs might find some on display in a menagerie in a northern city, in use as guardian creatures, or even kept by druids as loyal animal companions.
Another classic place that dinosaurs are found in fiction are in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal place to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day‑night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam.
In a fantasy setting, magical effects or supernatural influences can enhance dinosaurs by giving them unexpected attacks, modes of movement, or other abilities. You can quickly create a memorable magical beast simply by giving a dinosaur the magical attack of another creature of an equal level, such as a spinosaurus gaining an acidic breath weapon akin to that of an adult black dragon.
A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or a quick online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well. Armor-headed pachycephalosaurs, spike-thumbed iguanodons, duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed spinosauruses, and more await discovery by those who would seek out the mysteries of the lost worlds where the thunder lizards still rule!
Dinosaurs fit well into certain types of settings. They’re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Veranallia (Rebirth Azata).
Veranallias represent the freedom of life to grow, change, and adapt. They rarely interact directly with non-azatas, as most other beings find their nature hard to comprehend, but those who secure their aid find them powerful allies. The lower half of a veranallia's body is made of vegetation that constantly repeats a dizzying cycle of sprouting, blooming, thriving, and wilting. The upper half of their body appears as that of a humanoid of any gender—it is rare for a veranallia to remain consistent in their gender for more than a few seasons at a time.
Veranallias transform the landscape in their wake, bringing creation and destruction alike. The world around them overflows with an abundance of vegetation, with plenty of food for nearby animals, and when they bring destruction, they do so without cruelty, as it is sometimes necessary to make room for new life. They trigger forest fires in woodlands before dry brush piles up to dangerous levels, and bring bitter winters to areas plagued with parasites that thrive in hot weather.
The most powerful of all azatas belong to the cast of demigods known as empyreal lords. These lesser deities maintain many cults across many Material Plane worlds, and count among their kind such diverse demigods as Ashava, a protector of lost spirits and dancer in the moonlight; Black Butterfly, a mysterious agent of Desna and patron of the depths of outer space; and Sinashakti, joyful wanderer and deliverer of wisdom to vagabonds.
While azatas would like to think they are above material wealth, the truth is that most azatas adore finery and displays of beauty or grandeur. They might explain away bejeweled weapons as necessary tools against the forces of evil, or the wild array of jewelry and silks they wear as important diplomatic tools.
The wilds of Elysium play host to a wide array of azatas, the most varied and widespread of the celestials. From the four-eyed mothlike uinuja to the supernaturally verdant and beautiful veranallia, whose lower body is a wondrous garden of wildflowers and plant life, azatas are nothing if not diverse!
While the idyllic realm of Elysium is the home plane of azatas, their overwhelming curiosity and natural wanderlust often lead them to travel far from this plane. On other planes, they can be seeking to right wrongs, looking for entertainment, or merely exploring to see the sights. More than a few azatas, taken by a whimsical urge to spread their sometimes unwelcome jocosity, see it as their duty to tease uptight or humorless mortal creatures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Verdurous Ooze.
Verdurous oozes are found in temperate forests, warm jungles, or other places where plant life grows in abundance. Unlike many types of oozes, verdurous oozes are not particularly good climbers and have been known to get trapped in natural or artificial chasms. Warlords and wizards sometimes make use of that fact and keep verdurous oozes as guardians in pits around the walls of their fortresses or towers.
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms are usually found near each other, as the two oozes are part of the same life cycle. When a giant amoeba grows large enough, it can spontaneously split apart into two separate amoeba swarms, and when an amoeba swarm feeds enough, its individual components can fuse together into a single creature.
Many oozes have acidic attacks that can quickly degrade flesh, wood, and even stronger materials. Some believe that oozes are the result of alchemical or magical experimentation run amok, while others postulate that they simply emerged from the natural processes of evolution.
Many varieties of these nearly mindless predators exist in the world. Some are mere variants, with different colored puddings, jellies, and oozes with little to differentiate them from those presented here other than their habitat. Others are more specialized, or even dangerously intelligent. The shoggoth is one such example, but another variety of deadly and powerful ooze is the thankfully rare blight, a creature composed of protoplasm and eyes that curses entire regions with its presence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Vermlek (Worm Demon).
Vermleks, also called worm demons, manifest from the souls of mortals who desecrated the dead, such as grave robbers or necromancers. These fiends take their violations to a new extreme, using their demonic powers to horrifically core their living victims and don the flesh-husk that remains.
In its natural form, a vermlek resembles an oversized pinkish worm with four long tails that end in writhing fibrils. Its mouth splits into four segments like a profane tulip lined with rows of dozens of pointed teeth. More often than not, however, these fiends are encountered only after they have crawled into the body of a dead humanoid and made the hollowed-out flesh their temporary host. Vermleks use their powers of deception and disguise to infiltrate mortal settlements and influence unwitting acquaintances of the bodies they wear. Particularly intelligent or conniving vermleks might even reach stations of real power within the ranks of an army or government, at which point exposure of their true form can wreak havoc among the populace they have so thoroughly duped.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Vexgit.
These gremlins are covered head-to-toe by a crustacean-like exoskeleton that clacks and rattles whenever a vexgit moves. They delight in sabotaging the works of other creatures, often turning these works into dangerous traps. An individual vexgit might jam a door lock, loosen the wheels on a carriage, or remove nails from a boat hull. Buildings infested by vexgits become filled with traps like portcullises descending suddenly, water pipes exploding violently, and clock towers disgorging an avalanches of gears.
Aware of their own physical weakness, vexgits carry hammers and other tools to leverage pieces apart or smash whatever they're unable to disassemble. Indeed, a hammer sized for a human becomes a maul in the tiny hands of a vexgit.
Vexgit infestations range from one to a score. Larger groups are often led by a more powerful vexgit with additional skill in thievery or primal magic. Trained giant rats, vipers, and rat swarms are common in vexgit lairs.
All gremlins are hoarders, and their nests are cluttered with objects both valuable and worthless. Sorting through a gremlin nest can reveal unexpected treasures like pieces of jewelry or minor magic items, but care must also be taken to avoid being cut on rusty shards of metal, picking up cursed items, or disturbing a hidden nest of venomous vermin.
Superstitious societies sometimes hang tiny bells made of semiprecious metals in the belief that such bells will dissuade gremlins from destroying an affixed object or infesting a home. Strangely enough, most gremlins believe this superstition as well, and even when a gremlin bell hasn’t been magically enhanced, a gremlin usually won’t risk tinkering with objects that seem to be protected in such a manner.
Lawful evil gremlins are sometimes drawn to the worship of archdevils, though not in an orthodox fashion. Dispater is revered as the archdevil of cities—playgrounds to engage in thievery and sabotage. Mammon is worshipped as the bringer of wealth and protector of gremlin warrens that, like his domain of Erebus, are dark and trap-filled. Neutral evil gremlins have been known to worship Norgorber in his aspect as a patron of thieves, but pugwampis in particular prefer to worship gnolls (or at least, worship whoever the local gnolls worship). Chaotic evil gremlins often revere Andirifkhu, demon lord of illusions, knives, and traps. Those that retain a connection to the First World may swear allegiance to the Lantern King, Eldest of laughter, mischief, and transmutation.
Most know better than to employ gremlins, so when the fey creatures live side-by-side with others, it's often as parasites and unwelcome guests. Imaginative and sinister folk who find themselves infested sometimes catch the gremlins and release them in the homes of their enemies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Vine Lasher.
What first appears to be a simple shrub suddenly stirs to life.
The vine lasher attacks in groups, attempting to immobilize prey and slowly tear a creature to pieces.
These deadly organisms can be found in any hot or temperate environment, but like most plants, they need light and moisture to thrive.
While most forms of deadly flora do not value treasure in any way, their victims' wealth can usually be found strewn about their location, sometimes even buried in their roots. Due to the outdoors, the only things of value that are typically found are made from metal or stone, like weapons, armor, and some talismans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Violet Fungus.
At a glance, a violet fungus might seem to be little more than an unsightly and sickeningly purple mushroom of unusual size. Only once one draws closer— once whip-like tentacles dripping with flesh-rotting venom slither out from the fungus's cratered cap—does the terrifying truth of this carnivorous toadstool become apparent. Many amateur spelunkers have met untimely ends in the clutches of this monstrous fungus's tentacles, since violet fungi are practically synonymous with caverns on Golarion.
Anyone who has ever braved the world's caves for an extended period of time know the dangers of the deadly violet fungus. Darklands dwellers such as drow and duergars often bear the long, whip-like scars of at least one brush with this vicious plant's cruel, poison-infused tentacles. Canny subterranean trappers and scouts sometimes make use of cultivated violent fungi to catch game in the enormous caverns below the surface world. Some Darklands peoples also cultivate violet fungi as a means to defend their territory. Xulgaths in particular place violet fungi around the perimeters of their settlements as a first line of defense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Viper.
Each member of this family of venomous snakes has long, hinged fangs that inject potent venom in their prey. Different vipers inject different types of venom, which might result in paralysis, extreme pain and swelling, blood clotting, or even the sudden stopping of the victim’s heart.
Snakes of all sorts eat their meals by devouring their prey whole. After incapacitating a creature, a snake unhinges its jaw and consumes the creature entirely, even if it's more than twice the diameter of the snake's body. A snake can consume a creature of the same size as itself or smaller, but most snakes are logy and sluggish while the meal digests.
Snakeskin's distinctive pattern and wide variety of applications makes it a sought-after resource, and the hides of extra-large snakes such as giant anacondas can fetch a fine price in the right market. Such oversized snake hides can be used to craft clothing of snakeskin leather, including boots and gloves, as well as other items such as scabbards, backpacks, and even tents or makeshift boats. A snake's hide can be cleanly removed with a successful Crafting check or appropriate Lore check.
Snakes appear frequently and prominently in the myths and legends of many cultures throughout the Inner Sea region. In Ancient Osirion, snakes were revered and associated both with the evil serpent god Apep and the good goddess Wadjet, the Green Empress. Perhaps the best-known example of snakes in Golarion's legends are the serpentfolk— serpentine humanoids who ruled vast swaths of the world in prehistoric times and worshipped a foul snake deity called Ydersius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Viper Vine.
A voracious, flesh-eating carnivore, the viper vine has a single enormous blossom arising from a thick, leafy tangle of snake-like vines. When the plant senses the approach of suitable prey through its sensitive, shallowly buried root system, it rises up like an agitated snake and unfurls its brightly colored bloom, an act that releases a cloud of mind-numbing pollen. Persistent stories claim the viper vine can lure prey into its clutches by swaying with a hypnotic motion, but this effect is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.
Since a viper vine gains nourishment by consuming creatures rather than through ingesting moisture and soil, it has developed rudimentary locomotion and can drag itself along the ground with its tentacle-like roots. It even has a form of rudimentary sentience, allowing it to not only discern differences in prey and make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly large or dangerous-looking.
The area around viper vine hunting grounds is often strewn with the partially devoured remains of victims. It's not unusual to find the rotting corpses of wild animals, ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in the plant's immediate vicinity, along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind on the corpses. A viper vine rarely returns to the carcass of a creature it killed earlier, preferring to hunt fresh meat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Viskithrel.
One of the many horrid life-forms native to Zevgavizeb's Abyssal realm of Gluttondark, viskithrels—or “gluttonraptors”—are tireless hunters resembling tentacled theropods. They are social creatures by nature and prefer to hunt in large packs, chasing down prey and tearing them apart to share with their fellow hunters. A lone viskithrel forgoes hunting to frantically seek out others of its kind, starving to death if it cannot do so. Although viskithrels attack nearly any other creatures they encounter, they virtually never fight other viskithrels; even beasts in rival packs give each other space rather than fight over territory or prey.
Other, smarter denizens of Gluttondark, such as xilvireks herd and train viskithrels, working to convince the viskithrels that the trainer is one of their pack. This not only protects the trainer from attacks by the viskithrels, but also enables the trainer to easily direct them.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Vitalia.
Foul occult magic, rare alchemical reagents, and copious amounts of spilled blood are the keys to creating a vitalia—also known as a heart horror— though thankfully the exact means of their creation has been long forgotten.
Now, most vitalias now come into being by sheer accident. This unusual life-form cannot live without regular contact with blood, much like how fish cannot live long outside of water. Because of this, vitalias are rarely found outside the lairs of mad alchemists or wizards, living in pools of the life-giving substance. Physically, a vitalia somewhat resembles a blood-red giant jellyfish, though it also bears some semblance to a giant human heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Voidworm.
Other proteans don’t consider the flying, iridescent beings known as voidworms to be part of a protean caste at all, but instead merely a shameful side effect of the Maelstrom’s constantly churning energy. To call a voidworm a protean in the presence of a more powerful protean is as sure a way to instigate combat as any.
Voidworms themselves have little interest in whether anyone sees them as proteans. They maintain a thriving ecology in the Maelstrom, frolicking in schools of up to 20 and playing in the chaos of constantly shifting realities. Elsewhere (such as on the Material Plane), voidworms are mesmerized by the principle of object permanence; many latch onto specific features of a region (such as a hillside or pond) and flit through the air around it for months or even years as they wait for the object of their curiosity to change. Minor changes— such as a tree’s change of color in the fall, a corpse’s slow decay, or periodic venting of steam from a geyser—all fascinate voidworms. A voidworm is about 2 feet long and weighs 2 pounds.
Proteans divide themselves into a loose caste system and possess a dizzying variety of powers. Most proteans have a serpentine body with the head of a primeval beast. Scholars have long been intrigued by this fact—that scions of dissolution and disorder would share so many features—pointing out that even in the purest chaos there is some semblance of order. Others note that the serpentine form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion and lack of consensus surrounding their kind. After all, if even chaos cannot be trusted to be chaotic, would that not be the purest form of entropy?
Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves. When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature. D8Warpwave Effect 1Clumsy 2 (3 on a critical failure) 2Confused and gains 4d6 temporary Hit Points 3Dazzled (permanent on a critical failure) 4Enfeebled 2 (3 on a critical failure) 5Immobilized by filaments of energy 6Quickened (Stride, Strike, or Step only) 7Slowed 1 8Stupefied 2 (3 on a critical failure)
Among the numerous types of immortals that dwell in the Great Beyond, the proteans are surely some of the oldest. They’ve waged war against the inevitable aeons from the advent of their first creation, and speak longingly of that time before the gods themselves imposed order upon reality.
The Maelstrom, home of all proteans, is the whirling mass of turbulent primal energy, planar waves, and soul-stuff that surrounds the Outer Planes. Planar scholars theorize that all of reality was originally formed from the Maelstrom in the early days of the cosmos—a theory proteans don’t necessarily dispute.
Where proteans go, chaos follows. To proteans, there is no purer form of existence than entropy, and they constantly seek to oppose the establishment of order in the Great Beyond. However, proteans don’t see life as being incompatible with chaos; rather, they simply believe beings—immortal or not—deserve complete freedom on their own terms.
Many other proteans beyond those presented here dwell in the Maelstrom, including the spectral pelagastrs, the nearly humanoid shapechanging ourdivars, and the incredibly powerful izfiitars.
The most powerful of all proteans are a group of demigods known collectively as protean lords. Yet even their vast might pales in comparison to that of the mysterious Speakers of the Depths. The Speakers are the most enigmatic of the Maelstrom’s gods—even their exact nature is unknown, and scholars disagree as to whether they are even divinities or just aspects of the Maelstrom itself.
Individual proteans have two names: a traditional name in their hissing, confusing language; and an honorary title. The latter is easily translated to other languages, but a protean’s traditional name can only rarely be uttered in any tongue other than Protean. As such, most proteans tend to go by their titles when dealing with outsiders, referring to themselves as, for example, “Song of Gentle Poison” or “Sibilant Cry of the Storm.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Void Zombie.
A void zombie arises when a humanoid dies from an akata's void death affliction. This walking corpse is animated by a larval akata attached to the deceased creature's brain, using a grotesque feeding tendril that emerges from the corpse's mouth to drink blood from its victims.
A void zombie typically exists for only a few months before it collapses and the larval akata crawls free from the motionless shell. When it feels the natural end of its unlife approaching, a void zombie finds a secluded place to vomit forth the nearly mature akata larva, then withers away. The disgorged larva metamorphizes into a full-grown akata several hours later, usually eating the corpse as its first meal.
The name “void zombie” is something of a misnomer; though still compelled by necromantic energies, a void zombie is a host in the life cycle of a parasitic alien, not a mindless, reanimated corpse (despite their similar appearances). The fact that a typical void zombie shares the neutral alignment of the larval akata within, rather than the intrinsically evil nature of other zombies, has caused some scholars to push to reclassify them under other names. Suggestions have included “void dead,” “akata spawn,” or “bloodwalker,” but the visceral and compelling commonplace name has proven difficult to shed.
The driving force behind a void zombie's violence rises from the ravenous hunger of the alien parasite that serves as the channel for its animating negative energies. Necromancers have tried often to duplicate the void zombie, but without a larval akata hosted within, the result is simply a zombie with missing jaws or, at best, one that moves faster than normal. Others have compared a captive void zombie to a captive yellow musk thrall (page 301) in an attempt to discover a potential link between the two— after all, both are animated bodies controlled by a parasitic outside force. Strangely, a void zombie becomes particularly violent when encountering a yellow musk thrall, making direct comparisons of the two creatures particularly difficult, or even dangerous. The fact that a void zombie, unlike a yellow musk thrall, is actually undead may hold some clues as to the source of this strange behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Vrock (Wrath Demon).
When the gates to the Abyss swing wide, the first demons through are often vrocks, vulture-headed scions of rage who wheel through the air on black wings or dance with the exultation of their fiendish power. Their hatred for mortals is matched only by their desire to inflict suffering through their horrible screech or their devastating dance. Vrocks form from the souls of hateful mortals who are thus given another chance to inflict their rage on the world.
Vrocks often travel in small groups so as to make the best use of their dance of ruin ability, but they rarely appear in groups larger than four. Against small groups and individuals, they swoop down without fear, hoping to play with their prey before going for the kill. Against formidable foes, they are just as happy to fly above, using their dance of ruin to cast a storm of lightning down on them.
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet the desperate or wicked still do. Rituals like planar ally or planar binding are typical for long-term ends, and summon fiend for combat applications. For planar ally, demons sometimes accept offerings that aren't valuable if gifting them to a demon pushes the ritualist further into sin.
The most powerful demons are known as demon lords (the term is gender neutral in this case). Of these divinities, Lamashtu is the most powerful. Countless other demon lords exist, including Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri, and Zura.
The sprawling, heaving, changing realm of the Abyss is the planar home of demonic life, but demons can be found anywhere the capacity to sin exists. Evil or foolish conjurers are fond of calling upon demons for advice or darker needs. When the Abyss wears through the boundaries of reality to create wound-like portals into other worlds, demons can spill over to wreak incredible havoc.
Some demons specialize in the art of possessing creatures or objects to spread fear and chaos. In such cases a demon gains a powerful disguise with which to work its evils upon the world, a subterfuge that delights the demon.
When a sinful mortal soul is consigned to the Abyss, it spends time wallowing in the mire and feeding on filth. If it survives and is not itself eaten, the soul eventually ascends into a demon, as influenced by the nature of its sin, yet most demons are themselves capable of reproduction as well. The fecundity of demonic life is perhaps the greatest—and most threatening—aspect of these dangerous fiends.
The Abyss can corrupt living creatures through direct congress or supernatural infusion of Abyssal energies, resulting in monstrous hybrids. A half-demon should be a custom creature, but you can quickly generate one by giving an existing creature a few of a demon's abilities along with the demon's sin-related vulnerability. For example, a half-hezrou hill giant would gain purity vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite, swim Speed, and poisonous pustules. When swapping over abilities between creatures of different levels, be sure to adjust the numbers for the new level.
The Abyss may be the largest of the Outer Planes, and mortals have an equally large capacity to betray themselves, society, and the natural order of reality. With this limitless source for increasingly specialized sins, the Abyss is constantly generating new types of demons to plague reality. While the vast majority of these are swiftly destroyed and never rise again, enough survive that dozens, if not hundreds, of types of demons are known to exist beyond those listed here. The shadowy invidiak is a demon without a body, born of envious souls. The goat-faced, flame-hooved brimorak rises from the souls of arsonists. Slimy, horned blood demons spawn from assassins, boar demons from the greedy... the list goes on and on.
While they enjoy causing destruction themselves, most demons prefer to trick and tempt mortals into falling to sin of their own volition.
Some say that the nature of chaos inherently precludes cooperation and subtlety, but demons are proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Some classify sin into seven categories—envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While these sins embody some of the most powerful and numerous demons, far more than seven demons exist. Any act of cruelty or destruction a mortal takes to gratify the self at others’ expense is, in effect, a sin, and any such act can spawn a demon from a soul in the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Vrolikai (Death Demon).
Unlike other demons, the dread vrolikai doesn't form from a sinful soul—they instead manifest from a nabasu once the nabasu finally satisfies their hunger and returns to the Abyss, and as such vrolikais suffer from no vulnerability associated with a specific sin. A vrolikai who survives this process and the period of vulnerability that follows gains great power and in time can claim large regions of the Abyss as their own domain. Also known as death demons, these murderous monsters often serve demon lords as executioners or assassins.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Vrykolakas Ancient.
Vrykolakas ancients are the sinister overlords of their kind, stealing blood, breath, and life to feed their immortal hunger.
Vampires are undead creatures that feed on the blood of the living.
You can turn an existing living creature into a vrykolakas using the following steps. Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and it becomes evil. Increase AC, attack modifiers, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase Speed by 10 feet or to 40 feet, whichever results in a higher Speed. Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon’s Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.
If the base creature becoming a vrykolakas has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vrykolakas’ theme. All vrykolakas gain the following abilities.
Darkvision
Swift Tracker The vrykolakas moves at full Speed while Tracking.
Negative Healing
Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep
Feral Corruption (curse, divine, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, possession) Trigger The vrykolakas is reduced to 0 Hit Points, and an animal is within 100 feet; Effect Unlike most other undead, a vrykolakas isn’t destroyed when it reaches 0 HP. Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must attempt a Will save (use a high DC for the vrykolakas’s level from the Spell DC and Spell Attack Roll table). On a failure, the animal is possessed. This has the effects of the possession spell, but it lasts a number of days equal to the vrykolakas’s level. This possession can’t be counteracted with magic (though remove curse works against it normally).
If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a different animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save or no animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and is destroyed.
A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound below) immediately, burying itself there. While the vrykolakas is in this state of recovery, its animal host is paralyzed, and beheading it destroys the vrykolakas and kills its host. Removing the curse destroys the vrykolakas and returns the animal to normal. After 1d4 days, if the vrykolakas hasn’t been destroyed, the animal dies and the vrykolakas rises in a new body that’s identical to its previous one, formed from the animal’s remains.
Vrykolakas Vulnerabilities Vrykolakas all have the following vulnerabilities. Burial Site Bound A vrykolakas is bound to the place of its death or interment. It must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours, during which time it is paralyzed and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this host animal can’t return to the burial site before the possession effect ends, the vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal. Vulnerable to Decapitation A vrykolakas that is beheaded can’t use its Feral Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas.
Climb Speed A vrykolakas gains a climb Speed equal to one-half its land Speed.
Claws If the base creature had hands, it gains an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. Use the moderate damage for the creature’s level on the Strike Damage table.
Fangs The teeth of the vrykolakas grow long, sharp, and deadly, granting it a fangs Strike: an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage and enables the use of its Drink Blood ability. Use the high damage for the creature’s level on the Strike Damage table.
Drink Blood (divine, necromancy) Requirements The vrykolakas’ last action was a successful fangs Strike; Effect The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the creature’s Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes drained 1, and the vrykolakas regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that’s already drained doesn’t restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature’s drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that’s been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.
The target creature’s drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.
Rend The vrykolakas gains the Rend action with its claws.
Particularly powerful vrykolakas can create spawn from the bodies of their victims and gain additional abilities, as detailed below. Creatures of 9th level or higher can become a vrykolakas master, while those of 12th level or higher who have survived for centuries might become a vrykolakas ancient.
Children of the Night (divine, enchantment, mental) The presence of a vrykolakas master inspires savage creatures to crawl forth to do its bidding, including rat swarms, wargs, werewolves, and similar creatures. The vrykolakas master can give telepathic orders to these creatures within 100 feet, but they can’t communicate back.
Pestilential Aura (aura, divine, necromancy) 5 feet. Creatures beginning their turn in the area while the vrykolakas is in its true form are exposed to bubonic plague.
Divine Innate Spells The vrykolakas master can cast vampiric touch (heightened to half its level rounded up) and 3rd-level fear three times per day each as divine innate spells. It uses a high DC for its level.
Bubonic Plague (disease) Saving Throw Fortitude (use a high DC for the vrykolakas’s level); Onset 1 day; Stage 1 fatigued (1 day); Stage 2 enfeebled 2 and fatigued (1 day); Stage 3 enfeebled 3, fatigued, and takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage every 1d20 minutes (1 day) Change Shape (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) A vrykolakas master can transform into a form resembling the body it had in life, with the effects of humanoid form but with unlimited duration. It loses its fangs and claw Strikes but gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate in this form.
Create Spawn (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, a vrykolakas master can turn this creature into a vrykolakas spawn (page 276) by donating some of its own blood to the creature and burying it in earth for 3 nights. Such vrykolakas spawn are generally friendly to the vrykolakas that created them, but they are not under its control and typically wander off on their own rampage within 1d6 days of their creation. Dominate Animal (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) The vrykolakas can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell that affects only animals. The save DC is a high DC for the vrykolakas’s level, and a creature that succeeds is immune to that vrykolakas’s Dominate Animal for 24 hours. Destroying the vrykolakas ends the effect, but reducing it to 0 HP does not. A dominated animal takes a –4 circumstance penalty to saving throws against the vrykolakas’s Feral Possession.
Drink Blood As a typical vrykolakas, but the creature is drained 2 instead of 1.
Like vampires vrykolakas can infect victims with their twisted form of vampirism, transforming practically any living monster into one of these undead horrors. You can build a new vrykolakas from the ground up using the standard monster creation rules, which were used to create the vrykolakas spawn, vrykolakas master, and vrykolakas ancient, or you can use the guidelines presented under Creating a Vrykolakas to turn an existing creature (even a player character!) into a vrykolakas, adjusting the monster as you see fit. In either case, specific vrykolakas abilities like negative healing, Feral Corruption, and Drink Blood work the same.
Vrykolakas are corrupted bestial versions of their appearance in life, and are emaciated and pockmarked with disease. Their spines are bent in a perpetual hunch. While some vrykolakas can cloak themselves in a semblance of living flesh, their fragmented memories often cannot accurately recreate their former appearance or persona. They may not recognize former family and friends (and vice versa), but those they do remember are marked as their favored victims.
The vrykolakas (pronounced “vree-KO-la-kahss”) is an undead creature from Greek folklore. These revenants appear as humans come back after death to complete some task left undone before they can peacefully rest. Many are vengeful and murderous, but some are simply attempting to return to their former lives, like a shoemaker rising from the grave to mend his children's shoes, carry water, and chop firewood. The Pathfinder version of this creature is more associated with a feral form of vampire.
Most vrykolakas have curious affectations, such as a compulsion to knock on a door before entering or calling out the name of the person within. If the person answers, the vrykolakas then tries to hunt and slay them within 3 days. Others have an affinity for specific types of animals, always preferring to charm or possess them, or have an aversion to others. Unlike a moroi vampire, however, for a vrykolakas these habits are merely sadistic games or personal preferences, not mystical compulsions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Vrykolakas Master.
Vrykolakas masters are sinister shapechangers. They walk undetected among the living and prey upon them like a wolf among sheep, often leaving the corpses to rise as vrykolakas spawn.
Vampires are undead creatures that feed on the blood of the living.
You can turn an existing living creature into a vrykolakas using the following steps. Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Vrykolakas Spawn.
Vrykolakas unleash their spawn upon the world to spread terror, plague, and suffering and to draw attention away from their masters.
Vampires are undead creatures that feed on the blood of the living.
You can turn an existing living creature into a vrykolakas using the following steps. Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.

All vrykolakas gain the following abilities.
Darkvision
Swift Tracker The vrykolakas moves at full Speed while Tracking.
Negative Healing
Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep
Feral Corruption (curse, divine, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, possession) Trigger The vrykolakas is reduced to 0 Hit Points, and an animal is within 100 feet; Effect Unlike most other undead, a vrykolakas isn’t destroyed when it reaches 0 HP. Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must attempt a Will save (use a high DC for the vrykolakas’s level from the Spell DC and Spell Attack Roll table).

Vrykolakas Vulnerabilities Vrykolakas all have the following vulnerabilities. Burial Site Bound A vrykolakas is bound to the place of its death or interment. It must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours, during which time it is paralyzed and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this host animal can’t return to the burial site before the possession effect ends, the vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal. Vulnerable to Decapitation A vrykolakas that is beheaded can’t use its Feral Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas.
Climb Speed A vrykolakas gains a climb Speed equal to one-half its land Speed.
Claws If the base creature had hands, it gains an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. Use the moderate damage for the creature’s level on the Strike Damage table.
Fangs The teeth of the vrykolakas grow long, sharp, and deadly, granting it a fangs Strike: an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage and enables the use of its Drink Blood ability. Use the high damage for the creature’s level on the Strike Damage table.

The target creature’s drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.
Rend The vrykolakas gains the Rend action with its claws.
Particularly powerful vrykolakas can create spawn from the bodies of their victims and gain additional abilities, as detailed below. Creatures of 9th level or higher can become a vrykolakas master, while those of 12th level or higher who have survived for centuries might become a vrykolakas ancient.
Children of the Night (divine, enchantment, mental) The presence of a vrykolakas master inspires savage creatures to crawl forth to do its bidding, including rat swarms, wargs, werewolves, and similar creatures. The vrykolakas master can give telepathic orders to these creatures within 100 feet, but they can’t communicate back.
Pestilential Aura (aura, divine, necromancy) 5 feet. Creatures beginning their turn in the area while the vrykolakas is in its true form are exposed to bubonic plague.
Divine Innate Spells The vrykolakas master can cast vampiric touch (heightened to half its level rounded up) and 3rd-level fear three times per day each as divine innate spells. It uses a high DC for its level.
Bubonic Plague (disease) Saving Throw Fortitude (use a high DC for the vrykolakas’s level); Onset 1 day; Stage 1 fatigued (1 day); Stage 2 enfeebled 2 and fatigued (1 day); Stage 3 enfeebled 3, fatigued, and takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage every 1d20 minutes (1 day) Change Shape (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) A vrykolakas master can transform into a form resembling the body it had in life, with the effects of humanoid form but with unlimited duration. It loses its fangs and claw Strikes but gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate in this form.
Create Spawn (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, a vrykolakas master can turn this creature into a vrykolakas spawn (page 276) by donating some of its own blood to the creature and burying it in earth for 3 nights. Such vrykolakas spawn are generally friendly to the vrykolakas that created them, but they are not under its control and typically wander off on their own rampage within 1d6 days of their creation. Dominate Animal (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) The vrykolakas can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell that affects only animals. The save DC is a high DC for the vrykolakas’s level, and a creature that succeeds is immune to that vrykolakas’s Dominate Animal for 24 hours. Destroying the vrykolakas ends the effect, but reducing it to 0 HP does not. A dominated animal takes a –4 circumstance penalty to saving throws against the vrykolakas’s Feral Possession.
Drink Blood As a typical vrykolakas, but the creature is drained 2 instead of 1.
Like vampires vrykolakas can infect victims with their twisted form of vampirism, transforming practically any living monster into one of these undead horrors. You can build a new vrykolakas from the ground up using the standard monster creation rules, which were used to create the vrykolakas spawn, vrykolakas master, and vrykolakas ancient, or you can use the guidelines presented under Creating a Vrykolakas to turn an existing creature (even a player character!) into a vrykolakas, adjusting the monster as you see fit. In either case, specific vrykolakas abilities like negative healing, Feral Corruption, and Drink Blood work the same.
Vrykolakas are corrupted bestial versions of their appearance in life, and are emaciated and pockmarked with disease. Their spines are bent in a perpetual hunch. While some vrykolakas can cloak themselves in a semblance of living flesh, their fragmented memories often cannot accurately recreate their former appearance or persona. They may not recognize former family and friends (and vice versa), but those they do remember are marked as their favored victims.
The vrykolakas (pronounced “vree-KO-la-kahss”) is an undead creature from Greek folklore. These revenants appear as humans come back after death to complete some task left undone before they can peacefully rest. Many are vengeful and murderous, but some are simply attempting to return to their former lives, like a shoemaker rising from the grave to mend his children's shoes, carry water, and chop firewood. The Pathfinder version of this creature is more associated with a feral form of vampire.
Most vrykolakas have curious affectations, such as a compulsion to knock on a door before entering or calling out the name of the person within. If the person answers, the vrykolakas then tries to hunt and slay them within 3 days. Others have an affinity for specific types of animals, always preferring to charm or possess them, or have an aversion to others. Unlike a moroi vampire, however, for a vrykolakas these habits are merely sadistic games or personal preferences, not mystical compulsions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Warg.
Wargs hunt in packs and surround their prey like common wolves, but their cunning and penchant for taunting victims makes them easy to distinguish from their less-intelligent cousins. But despite their intelligence, wargs have simple desires for food and shelter, making them easy for evil humanoids such as orcs and hobgoblins to recruit to protect their camps or join them in battle. Most wargs are amenable to this arrangement, but if food should run out, wargs are more than willing to integrate goblinoid flesh into their diet.
Wargs are the subject of many grim tales and campfire stories. Frightening accounts of wargs gobbling up children whole have a disturbing basis in fact, for these ravenous creatures have jaws that can unhinge like those of a serpent to gulp down small prey while the victim yet lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a War Horse.
<i>This entry did not have a separate description for the creature.</i>
Goblins have many superstitions and quirks, but few of them are stronger than their fear and hatred of horses. This isn’t a one-sided affair. Horses also fear and hate goblins, and some have been known to go out of their way to harm a goblin. A goblin trying to mount a horse is nearly always subject to a torrent of violent bucking, as the horse does everything in its power to fling the goblin to the ground and within reach of its hooves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Describe a Warsworn.
A warsworn is an animate mass of corpses composed of dozens, sometimes even hundreds, of victims of battle. They are formed by deities of undeath or war or, rarely, spontaneously manifest from the devastation of an especially horrendous battle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Wasp Swarm.
Wasp nests are made of chewed wood fibers foraged from the surrounding flora, which the wasps make into a material similar to paper. A single wasp nest can house thousands of individuals that emerge as a massive swarm. Most swarms attack only to protect their nest or if otherwise agitated, though druids and other primal enchanters can bend these venomous vermin to their will—to deadly effect.
The poison of the giant wasp loses its potency soon after being harvested, but alchemists have learned of a way to preserve some of its properties by adding a number of harsh additives; this method makes it even deadlier.
Wasps are upheld as sacred among the priesthood of the elven deity Calistria, goddess of vengeance. Some priests of Calistria summon giant wasps or wasp swarms as servitors, while a few nurture giant wasps as pets, temple guardians, or companions. Followers of Calistria, both clergy and laypeople alike, seek to emulate the wasp’s penchant for leaving stung victims alive to suffer over a long period: a fitting model for revenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Water Mephit.
Water mephits are consummate jokers who are always happy to trade a favor for a good laugh. Just as fire mephits are the ones who cleave closest to evil without fully crossing over into true villainy, water mephits are the friendliest of the mephits and therefore the closest to good. Still, one should take care in making assumptions about a water mephit’s benevolence, for no one can reliably count on them to keep their inborn need for pranks and trickery at bay for long. Water mephits have blue-green skin that shimmers in light like sh scales. Though water mephits’ wings look more like webbed fins than limbs capable of flight, they can flap their wings to fly through the air as easily as any other mephit. Water mephits prefer to swim, when possible, and they leave the water only when they must.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Mephits are a favorite target for low-level spellcasters to summon, both because they have several useful abilities and because they are relatively easy to command and manipulate. Still, care must be taken when using mephits as minions, because if left unwatched or unattended for too long, they can cause all sorts of mischief.
Different types of mephits that can be found on the same elemental plane often develop friendly (or, in some cases, fierce) rivalries with one another. While mephits from elementally opposed planes (such as fire and water) may have strong opinions about the superiority of their own element, the fact that they rarely see such mephits means that when they do encounter them, they often get along better than they do with their close neighbors.
Perhaps because they're so often compelled into service by mortal conjurers and more powerful elementals, mephits tend to adopt long names peppered with self-proclaimed titles and imagined or exaggerated accomplishments to alleviate their feelings of inadequacy. Some examples of mephit names follow. Anothoraxia, Lurker in Dark Places, the Tragic Hero, One Against AllSilothiscil the Embittered, Rimelord of the Eternal Chill, Lord of IciclesOglophax, Prince of Pungency, the Viscous One, the Forever StainZarnozath the Magnificent, First of His Name, Boiler of Kettles, the Teapot Terror
The four mephits presented here are but the most common of their kind. Others that rise from the mixing of elemental energies exist as well: creatures like dust mephits (who breathe out a scouring cloud of grit), ice mephits (who spit out sickening gusts of frozen air), magma mephits (which can assume the form of a pool of lava), ooze mephits (which spit out foul-smelling acid), salt mephits (who can draw moisture out of the environs and nearby creatures), and steam mephits (which can call down tiny squalls of boiling rain).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Water Orm.
Legendary creatures lurking in remote lakes, water orms always find their way into the tavern tales of lakeside communities. To some travelers, every lake of respectable size seems to be surrounded by towns full of fishers claiming to have spotted a water orm. These elusive creatures inhabit lakes mainly in cool and gloomy regions. Some claim that water orms are an offshoot of sea serpents and linnorms, but no credible link between these creatures has been found.
Water orms have many features that sea serpents do not, such as the ability to understand the rudiments of language. Their natural inclination to avoid contact and remain hidden often remains at odds with their equally compelling curiosity about those they might spy upon the shores of their lakes. Water orm sightings usually occur when they can't help but to rise up to the surface to take a peek at someone (or something) particularly unusual on the beach or floating on the water's surface.
These creatures are extremely long-lived and can go for decades, or even centuries, with very little to eat. This allows water orms to subsist in lakes without surfacing for many years, even in bodies of fresh water without ample food sources. Water orms might lie in a silty lake bed for years, their elusiveness only contributing to their mythical reputation. When a pet or child goes missing near a lake, rumors might hold that the local water orm is responsible, leading to folk tales that caution residents against venturing out alone near the water.
While most water orms are described as serpentine or long-necked reptiles, others look similar to bizarrely elongated seals or whales, impossibly large sea horses, or long-necked creatures with paddles resembling those of elasmosauruses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Water Yai.
Among the most powerful yai are those who emulate the form of storm giants. Rather than lord over their giant-kin like most oni, though, water yai prefer to lurk alone in the world's oceans (or, much more rarely, large and remote freshwater lakes). When a water yai must interact with mortals beneath the waves, they prefer to do so while disguised as a storm giant. Water yai pursue the acquisition of material wealth and riches above all other interests, garbing themselves in richly colored, magically waterproofed kimonos and adorning their monstrous faces with all manner of jewelry. These yai can infuse their kimonos with eerie magical properties, and in combat, they can also fire bolts of electricity from their third eye.
When an oni manifests, they always do so in a form that parodies a specific humanoid ancestry closely associated with the oni’s obsessions and envies. Giants’ over-the-top personalities and sizes are likely the reason why these humanoids are the most common incarnations chosen by oni; such oni are known collectively as yai oni. Yet there exist oni associated with almost every kind of humanoid. Most oni are capable of supernaturally disguising themselves as their associated humanoid type and use this ability to infiltrate societies and seize control from within. Once established, oni typically reveal their true form and revel in dominating those they view as lesser beings fit only to serve their whims.
Oni are nothing if not vain. They typically choose comely or striking appearances in their humanoid disguises—forms that are completely at odds with the ugliness of their true natures. An oni’s true form is indicative of their innermost desires and always has features such as oversized teeth that verge into tusks, sharp claws, unusually bright skin colors, or a third eye in the forehead. Oni have desires as varied as those of any being, though by their nature these desires are almost always for hedonistic or destructive experiences of the flesh, typically food, pleasure, or violence.
Oni daimyo are quasi-deities with isolated mortal domains. The most powerful is Inma, the Empress of the World, but Akuma the Horned King, Murona the Dark Mother, and Nataka the Red King are also worshipped.
The first oni originated in the nation of Minkai on the continent of Tian Xia. Whether due to prevalent local kami— particularly in the mist-shrouded Forest of Spirits—or its peoples' faiths, Minkai is a hotbed of oni activity.
Oni humanoid forms are limited to one specific appearance. An ogre magecan assume only one specific ogre form, while an ice yai can appear only as one specific frost giant. Some oni have greater control over their shapeshifting power and can assume the form of any humanoid creature, and these oni tend to be the most dangerous.
Different oni exist for nearly every humanoid ancestry. Kuwa oni mask their golden skin and four-fingered claws in human form, while ja oni hide as hobgoblins. Other yai include wind yai (who take their form from cloud giants) and the immensely powerful void yai (who form from other yai and ascend to rule over rune giants).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Web Lurker.
Web lurkers, known also as ettercaps, are ugly monsters that not only dwell within the lairs of spiders and swarms, but actively cultivate and shepherd such vermin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Wemmuth.
Fertilized by large quantities of spilled blood, such as that found on bloodstained battlefields or in the war-torn regions surrounding besieged cities, wemmuths are vile swaths of vines that draw sustenance from mortal suffering, lapping up blood like water. Possessing a rudimentary intelligence and an unquenchable thirst for blood, wemmuths lie in wait for most of their lives, growing to incredible size in the bloody soil of their grisly homes. Though the vines that comprise a wemmuth’s body are scarcely thicker than rope, a single adult wemmuth system consists of 6 tons of vines, enough to stretch for 6,000 feet if stretched from end to end in a single straight line. Wemmuths never orient themselves this way, however, instead preferring to wrap themselves into massive mounds approximately 15 feet across and equally thick. Although wemmuths are often spotted lazing about, the scent of blood is enough to whip one into a violent frenzy. The creature condenses its entire mass into a sphere of sharp thorns and lashing vines, resembling a hateful tumbleweed the size of an elephant. Wemmuths commonly dig up massive boulders or entire trees from the ground and incorporate them into their rolling mass, using these objects to bolster their defense against many forms of attack or hurling them at faraway foes with terrifying precision.
Some speculate that wemmuths are a form of diabolical corruption let loose upon Golarion by House Thrune of Cheliax, perhaps as a scorched earth tactic against their rivals. Influential nobles from Nirmathas and Molthune both point fingers at one another for the wemmuth’s creation, Nirmathas citing Molthune’s close ties to Infernal Cheliax and Molthune blaming the primal magic commonly employed by Nirmathas’s many druids and rangers. Several Varisian tales describe creatures closely matching the wemmuth’s description attempting to apprehend a famous folk trickster, while crusaders from Mendev adhere to the belief that the wemmuths were a blight unleashed upon Golarion by Deskari, former demon lord of locusts, before his defeat at the hands of mortal heroes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Wendigo.
Wendigos are incarnations of the fears of starvation, loneliness, and fatal exposure to cold weather. They haunt the frozen expanses of the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Werebear.
Unlike many other types of werecreature, a werebear does not become malevolent during its involuntary transformations, but is instead filled with righteous conviction. This indignation can still manifest in violent ways, though, as a transformed werebear becomes temporarily blind to its alliances and has little control over its bestial temper. As a result, werebears are loners, rarely even living together as families longer than necessary. Werebears know that as long as they live solitary lives, they can serve as protectors and guardians in wilderness regions without the overwhelming fear that, when the moon is full and the curse takes hold, they will rage against an innocent bystander or loved one. As long as there is nothing around to threaten it or the natural area it protects (typically a forest), a werebear in its animal form is generally content to forage and sleep away the night.
Werecreatures come in two types: those afflicted with the curse and those born with it (“true werecreatures”).
One can be born a true werecreature to any werecreature parent. A true werecreature is always a werecreature and retains the same memories and most of the same statistics in all forms. A true werecreature also has full control over its shapechanging except during the full moon, when the transformation is irresistible. There is no known way to break the curse on a true werecreature.
Affected werewolves received their curse from the bite of another werecreature (which could’ve been an afflicted or true werecreature). An afflicted werecreature may be unaware of its curse because it retains no memories of its transformations, gets no benefit from being a werecreature when not transformed, and has no conscious control over its transformation. An afflicted werecreature’s curse can be removed like any other.
You can turn an existing, living humanoid into a werecreature by completing the following steps. (These changes reflect a werecreature in its hybrid form.) Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the beast and werecreature traits, and its alignment is usually adjusted to match that of its werecreature type. Increase its size by one category if the animal is a larger size than the base humanoid. Increase its AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If the werecreature is limited in how often it can use an ability (such as a breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Increase its HP by the amount shown on the table. This HP increase is more than typical in order to compensate for the creature's weakness to silver. The creature gains weakness to silver as shown on the table. Starting LevelHP IncreaseWeakness to Silver 4 or lower+255 5–7+357 8–14+5010 15++7515
All werecreatures gain the following abilities, some of which match an ability of the animal the werecreature transforms into. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of the werecreature (such as abilities with a conflicting alignment trait).
Senses The werecreature gains all the senses of the animal.
Animal Empathy (divination, primal) A werecreature can communicate with animals of the same general kind.
Claws The werecreature gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.
Jaws The creature gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage) that inflicts its curse of the werecreature. If it had any non-agile attacks, the damage dealt by its jaws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only agile attacks, its jaws should deal one-third more damage.
Change Shape (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The werecreature changes into its humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true werecreature's natural form is its hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, the werecreature uses its original humanoid size, loses its jaws and claws Strikes, and gains a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by its claw. In animal shape, its Speed and size change to that of the animal, it gains any special Strike effects of the animal that it didn't already have (such as Grab), and it loses its weapon Strikes.
Curse of the Werecreature (curse, necromancy, primal) This curse affects only humanoids. Saving Throw Fortitude DC is the standard DC for the werecreature's new level – 1. On each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another Fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature until dawn. The creature is under the GM's control and goes on a rampage for half the night before falling unconscious until dawn.
Moon Frenzy (polymorph, primal, transmutation) When a full moon appears in the night sky, the werecreature must enter hybrid form, can't Change Shape thereafter, becomes one size larger, increases its reach by 5 feet, and increases the damage of its jaws by 2. When the moon sets or the sun rises, the werecreature returns to humanoid form and is fatigued for 2d4 hours.
The curse of the werecreature comes in myriad forms and can affect any humanoid, allowing you to make a wide variety of werecreatures for your adventures. When you need to create a werecreature for your game, you can do so in one of two ways. You can simply build the werecreature from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the werebear, wererat, and werewolf presented on these pages were built). Or you can use the guidelines presented under “Creating Werecreatures” to turn an existing creature (or even a player character!) into a werecreature. In either case, specific werecreature abilities like Change Shape, curse of the werecreature, and moon frenzy work the same.
Many scholars refer to the curse of the werecreature as “lycanthropy,” but technically this is correct only when speaking of werewolves. Nevertheless, the word has gained traction in certain circles, and as a result it's not uncommon to hear the whispers of locals who fear lycanthropes even when a ravenous weretiger is the real threat. Naturally, the werecreatures themselves don't take this ignorance lightly, and tend to see being equated with a werewolf as a great insult. Unless, of course, the werecreature is a werewolf!
In theory, any animal could form the basis for a new type of werecreature, provided the animal in question is at least omnivorous—herbivorous werecreatures are all but unheard of. Werecreatures that rise from insects, arachnids, and similar invertebrate animals are particularly unsettling, though much rarer than werecreatures of vertebrate animals.
Werecreatures are notorious for their murderous rampages in the deep of the night—violence that is often at odds with the afflicted’s true nature. Even an honorable town guard or priest could be a murderous werewolf without realizing it, for the werecreature’s curse leaves the afflicted with no memory of their nocturnal murder sprees.
Wolfsbane is a poisonous plant that can cure the curse of the werecreature. It’s effective only if consumed before the creature transforms for the first time. If the creature survives wolfsbane’s effects without using magic to aid in surviving, the creature can attempt a new saving throw against the curse of the werecreature. On a success, the creature is cured.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Wereboar.
Wereboars tend to be aggressive and stubborn, and often live with their own kind in small, remote communities. Even when they're inclined to interact with others, wereboars' short tempers and hostile nature lead other creatures to avoid them. Lone wereboars who settle down—often on remote farms—are extremely territorial, though others are content to roam and explore lands far from home. Their other habits also vary widely from individual to individual, right down to diet: some wereboars might feast on human flesh, while others are mostly vegetarian.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Wererat.
Wererats tend to be selfishly opportunistic, avaricious, and paranoid as a result of their curse. Because wererats typically dwell in metropolitan areas where they can hide in plain sight, practically any city-goer could be a wererat in disguise—from the quiet shopkeep to the city’s criminal mastermind. The bustle of crowds and countless rat-holes make ghettos and shantytowns favored homes for wererats, especially since in these poorer districts the wererat can kill out of greed or fear with little chance of the authorities noticing. In some cities, wererats operate entire thieves’ guilds or organized crime rings, and membership requires willfully submitting to the wererat’s cursed bite. Wererats look very similar to ratfolk when in hybrid form, apart from potential differences in size, but ratfolk have no love for these monsters.
Werecreatures come in two types: those afflicted with the curse and those born with it (“true werecreatures”).
One can be born a true werecreature to any werecreature parent. A true werecreature is always a werecreature and retains the same memories and most of the same statistics in all forms. A true werecreature also has full control over its shapechanging except during the full moon, when the transformation is irresistible. There is no known way to break the curse on a true werecreature.
Affected werewolves received their curse from the bite of another werecreature (which could’ve been an afflicted or true werecreature). An afflicted werecreature may be unaware of its curse because it retains no memories of its transformations, gets no benefit from being a werecreature when not transformed, and has no conscious control over its transformation. An afflicted werecreature’s curse can be removed like any other.
You can turn an existing, living humanoid into a werecreature by completing the following steps. (These changes reflect a werecreature in its hybrid form.) Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the beast and werecreature traits, and its alignment is usually adjusted to match that of its werecreature type. Increase its size by one category if the animal is a larger size than the base humanoid. Increase its AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If the werecreature is limited in how often it can use an ability (such as a breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Increase its HP by the amount shown on the table. This HP increase is more than typical in order to compensate for the creature's weakness to silver. The creature gains weakness to silver as shown on the table. Starting LevelHP IncreaseWeakness to Silver 4 or lower+255 5–7+357 8–14+5010 15++7515
All werecreatures gain the following abilities, some of which match an ability of the animal the werecreature transforms into. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of the werecreature (such as abilities with a conflicting alignment trait).
Senses The werecreature gains all the senses of the animal.
Animal Empathy (divination, primal) A werecreature can communicate with animals of the same general kind.
Claws The werecreature gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.
Jaws The creature gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage) that inflicts its curse of the werecreature. If it had any non-agile attacks, the damage dealt by its jaws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only agile attacks, its jaws should deal one-third more damage.
Change Shape (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The werecreature changes into its humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true werecreature's natural form is its hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, the werecreature uses its original humanoid size, loses its jaws and claws Strikes, and gains a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by its claw. In animal shape, its Speed and size change to that of the animal, it gains any special Strike effects of the animal that it didn't already have (such as Grab), and it loses its weapon Strikes.
Curse of the Werecreature (curse, necromancy, primal) This curse affects only humanoids. Saving Throw Fortitude DC is the standard DC for the werecreature's new level – 1. On each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another Fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature until dawn. The creature is under the GM's control and goes on a rampage for half the night before falling unconscious until dawn.
Moon Frenzy (polymorph, primal, transmutation) When a full moon appears in the night sky, the werecreature must enter hybrid form, can't Change Shape thereafter, becomes one size larger, increases its reach by 5 feet, and increases the damage of its jaws by 2. When the moon sets or the sun rises, the werecreature returns to humanoid form and is fatigued for 2d4 hours.
The curse of the werecreature comes in myriad forms and can affect any humanoid, allowing you to make a wide variety of werecreatures for your adventures. When you need to create a werecreature for your game, you can do so in one of two ways. You can simply build the werecreature from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the werebear, wererat, and werewolf presented on these pages were built). Or you can use the guidelines presented under “Creating Werecreatures” to turn an existing creature (or even a player character!) into a werecreature. In either case, specific werecreature abilities like Change Shape, curse of the werecreature, and moon frenzy work the same.
Many scholars refer to the curse of the werecreature as “lycanthropy,” but technically this is correct only when speaking of werewolves. Nevertheless, the word has gained traction in certain circles, and as a result it's not uncommon to hear the whispers of locals who fear lycanthropes even when a ravenous weretiger is the real threat. Naturally, the werecreatures themselves don't take this ignorance lightly, and tend to see being equated with a werewolf as a great insult. Unless, of course, the werecreature is a werewolf!
In theory, any animal could form the basis for a new type of werecreature, provided the animal in question is at least omnivorous—herbivorous werecreatures are all but unheard of. Werecreatures that rise from insects, arachnids, and similar invertebrate animals are particularly unsettling, though much rarer than werecreatures of vertebrate animals.
Werecreatures are notorious for their murderous rampages in the deep of the night—violence that is often at odds with the afflicted’s true nature. Even an honorable town guard or priest could be a murderous werewolf without realizing it, for the werecreature’s curse leaves the afflicted with no memory of their nocturnal murder sprees.
Wolfsbane is a poisonous plant that can cure the curse of the werecreature. It’s effective only if consumed before the creature transforms for the first time. If the creature survives wolfsbane’s effects without using magic to aid in surviving, the creature can attempt a new saving throw against the curse of the werecreature. On a success, the creature is cured.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Weretiger.
These ferocious werecreatures stalk prey with the cunning and skill of a true apex predator. Weretigers typically view all life as a potential meal. Powerful nocturnal hunters with excellent senses that help them ambush prey, weretigers are adaptable to an extreme range of environments. However, weretigers living in densely populated cities (potentially as courtesans, assassins, or guild leaders) often struggle to suppress their killer instincts, becoming overwhelmed by the urge to hunt. They prefer to wear loose-fitting clothing and rely on their claws and jaws in a fight.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Werewolf.
The curse of the werewolf—known as lycanthropy to many—instills in its carriers the hungry bloodlust and predatory instincts of the wolf. Werewolves tend to dwell on the fringes of society or in small settlements where, in their humanoid forms, they work as laborers, hunters, farmers, or trappers. At night, however, these same villagers transform into violent killers and sadistic stalkers who prey on their neighbors. Werewolves are the quintessential werecreature, and the first that comes to mind when most people speak of such beings.
Although most werewolves hide their curse by adopting solitary lifestyles, some retain the pack mentality of true wolves. A small group of such werewolves typically forms a family-like pack, with the eldest or most powerful serving as the leader; new pack mates are hand-chosen and inculcated into the family as its influence grows.
Werecreatures come in two types: those afflicted with the curse and those born with it (“true werecreatures”).
One can be born a true werecreature to any werecreature parent. A true werecreature is always a werecreature and retains the same memories and most of the same statistics in all forms.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Wight.
Wights are undead humanoids that, much like wraiths, can drain the life from living creatures with but a touch. They arise as a result of necromantic rituals, especially violent deaths, or the sheer malevolent will of the deceased.
As many types of wights exist as types of people from which they might be created. Hulking brutes, skittering sneaks, and cunning tinkers all make for different wights with different niches to fill. Environment, too, plays a part in determining a wight’s special abilities and defenses. Frost wights, for instances, can be found in the parts of the world where exposure is a common end. Regardless, wights typically haunt burial grounds, catacombs, or other places of the dead. But their hunger is targeted toward the living—those individuals who remind them of the shackles of mortality and whom they feel compelled to “free” to the state of undeath.
A single wight can wreak a lot of havoc if it is compelled to rise from its tomb. Because creatures slain by wights become wights as well, all it takes is a single wight and a handful of unlucky graveyard visitors to create a veritable horde of these undead. Thus, canny priests and adventurers know that the best solution to a wight problem is swift and total eradication. Care must be taken, though, to destroy wight spawn before attempting to destroy the parent wight, for spawn without a master gain the ability to create spawn of their own.
Durable and sustained as they are by negative energy, wights can last in harsh environments without decaying the way some lesser undead do. They might dwell in high mountain passes, sealed passageways, or submerged in bogs or lakes for decades or even centuries before the passage of an unsuspecting traveler rouses them from their rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Will-o’-Wisp.
Malevolent balls of colored light, will-o’-wisps haunt lonely marshes and forests where they lure unsuspecting travelers into danger. Will-o’-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn’t, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o’-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.
Beneath its glow, a will-o’-wisp’s body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o’-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o’-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o’-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o’-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.
Will-o’-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o’-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they’re lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o’-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don’t tire of certain flavors of fear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Winter Wolf.
Winter wolves are related to wargs, but are larger, smarter, and far more dangerous. They are capable of exhaling plumes of freezing breath and are big enough to easily serve as mounts for orcs and hobgoblins—provided the winter wolf is willing, of course. Like wargs, winter wolves hunt in packs, but unlike their smaller cousins, they have a notable proud streak. When they deign to serve others, they reserve this privilege for larger and more dangerous creatures such as frost giants, renegade yetis, or even white dragons.
Wargs are the subject of many grim tales and campfire stories. Frightening accounts of wargs gobbling up children whole have a disturbing basis in fact, for these ravenous creatures have jaws that can unhinge like those of a serpent to gulp down small prey while the victim yet lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Witchfire.
Manifesting as a sinuous form wreathed in sickly green flames, this incorporeal undead forms when a powerful hag or witch dies in agony or rage. The body at the center of the flames usually resembles the witch's idealized self-image, regardless of their age and appearance at the time of their death.
A witchfire often resides in a bog or swamp, which slowly blackens and decays around them. These regions are often plagued by will-o'-wisps, which seem to have an uncanny relationship with the resident witchfire. A witchfire might visit villages on the edge of their home terrain to lure away villagers, but always attack victims within earshot to make sure that other villagers hear the screams. A witchfire might also ally with other hags or witches and even join their covens, but a witchfire is incapable of forming covens entirely on their own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Witchwyrd.
Witchwyrds conceal most of their faces, leaving only their eyes unmasked. Their inscrutability is a boon to one of their most significant interests—mercantilism— and many haughty witchwyrds openly revel in the befuddlement inspired by their mysterious guises and mannerisms. Witchwyrds have a keen eye for new opportunities and markets, and a witchwyrd almost always knows when someone is trying to pull one over on them.
These four-armed humanoid creatures have hairless blue-gray skin, are typically 6-1/2 feet tall, and weigh 300 pounds. Their hands have three evenly sized and spaced digits in a tripod-like arrangement. When not trying to blend in with the local community, witchwyrds favor outlandish, loose-fitting clothes in bright reds or yellows and a signature conical hat. They tend to prefer the driest, warmest regions of the lands they visit—perhaps an indicator of their mysterious home world. This, however, is the only indicator; witchwyrds are notoriously close-mouthed about details of this distant world, and with good reason: most witchwyrds on Golarion have never visited their ancestral home. To these witchwyrds, the notion of a home planet is a constant thorn in their side, and when asked, many choose to ignore the question altogether. Others are so agitated by these queries that they respond with impatience or even violence. Some scholars have theorized a connection between witchwyrds and several other four-armed creatures, but like with questions of their place of origin, witchwyrds have little to say about the topic.
High-ranking or wealthy witchwyrds rarely travel the planes alone, employing bodyguards to accompany them and leading entourages composed of various strange beings they've met during their travels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Wolf.
Wolves live and hunt in packs, which, contrary to popular belief, are not led by the strongest in the group, but typically consist of a mated pair, their pups, and juvenile offspring from previous mating seasons. Offspring generally leave their parents’ pack upon reaching maturity, at which point they seek out mates of their own to go form their own packs elsewhere.
Humanoids are not traditionally viewed as prey animals by wolves, but extraordinary circumstances can lead these animals to attack people, especially in winter months and other situations where traditional prey (deer and elk, mainly) is scarce. Some beings, such as powerful vampires, can call upon wolves to aid them in combat.
Wolf packs claim and defend large swaths of territory, which they regularly patrol in search of both prey and competitors. It takes a pack roughly 10 days to cover the entire breadth of its territory, which can stretch for miles in any direction but usually adheres to natural terrain. Wolves keep claim over their territories by marking trees with their scent and howling to keep other packs away. If these warnings prove insufficient to drive off potential competitors, the pack attacks the intruders directly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Wolverine.
Wolverines resemble small bears, to which they are related. Stocky and muscular with long claws, wolverines are about 3 feet in length and weigh approximately 40 pounds. They have a thick fur coat that protects them from the cold temperatures of the forests and frozen tundras where they reside.
Wolverines are territorial animals and fiercely defend their kills, even from larger predators or when they're outnumbered. They claim wide swaths of forests or frozen tundra as their territory, marking it with a pungent odor that serves as a warning to those who recognize the smell. Wolverines have voracious appetites and tend to aggressively devour their food with reckless abandon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Wood Giant.
Wood giants are the denizens and protectors of the deepest, most primeval forests in the world. They dedicate their entire lives to the preservation of nature—a role that they believe nature itself has selected them to carry out. Wood giants are patient and kind to those who show respect and care for wild places. Although most wood giants consider civilization as simply another part of the world, they value places untouched by permanent structures and dense humanoid settlements.
Wood giants have long, drooping ears and more slender builds than most giants. Despite their size, they are graceful and agile, able to move through dense forests and brush with little sound. They have been known to work closely with druids and others who share their respect for the sanctity of wilderness regions. Wood giants spend their days patrolling vast swaths of territory, foraging, and keeping an eye out for any who would despoil their lands. While they respect the connection to nature they share with many fey creatures and remain on good terms with them, wood giants see most fey as far too flighty to take part in any long-term plans.
An average wood giant stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds.
Giants often keep an eclectic collection of treasures in their knapsacks or bags. Among these can be found a staggeringly wide range of unexpected and odd treasures and valuables.
As oversized as they are, giants tend to dwell in remote regions of the world, where they have the luxury of claiming larger territories of their own.
As with many people, giants enjoy keeping pets. Yet for giants, what constitutes a pet is often categorized as beast to others. Large animals like bears and lions, and megafauna like woolly mammoths and dinosaurs are popular, as are more magical creatures like hell hounds, manticores, griffons, and the like.
Beyond the giants detailed here, many others dwell in remote regions of the world. Marsh giants are cultists who worship strange sea deities, shadow giants have ties to the Shadow Plane, and mountain giants are horrific butchers even other giants fear.
Giants are larger-than-life foes. While many giants have themes that tie them to elemental or magical forces, the primary theme giants share is that they embody a classic cultural trope as their basis. Fire giants, for example, can be seen as oversized smiths, while hill giants should evoke the flavor of an oversized bully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Wood Golem.
Wood golems are often given vaguely humanoid shapes, almost as if cobbled together from scraps of firewood and discarded burls. It's less common for wood golems to have artistic embellishments such as engraved patterns, or to be carved in the shapes of different types of creatures to meet the tastes of their owners. While wealthy patrons have been known to commission wood golems to be painstakingly carved to resemble themselves or their ancestors, to serve dual purposes of protection and ego bolstering, most wood golem crafters don't bother. Druids and creatures who protect woodlands, such as arboreals, typically see wood golems as an affront or an abomination, akin to the horror humanoids often feel when facing a carrion or flesh golem. As a result, it is rare to see such creatures serving as guardians for fey or druidic holy sites, despite the thematic match between the wood golem's appearance and such locations.
Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called “golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.
Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell can affect the golem.
Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.
Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.
Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Wooly Rhinoceros.
Even bulkier than their non-woolly cousins, these rhinoceroses have a shaggy pelt of long, thick fur and a huge crescent-shaped horn. Woolly rhinos inhabit areas of arid tundra and cold steppes, spending much of their day grazing for sustenance.
While some species have only a single horn, many rhinos, including woolly rhinos, have a second, smaller horn on their brow directly behind the larger one. Despite their appearance and durability, rhino horns aren't bone or ivory, but rather are composed of the same substance as hooves and toenails. A rhino's horn continues to grow as it ages, enabling a rhino to slowly regrow a broken horn. While some value rhino horns as trophies, the horns themselves have no intrinsic value.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Worm That Walks.
This worm that walks was a cultist of the Great Old One Hastur in its prior life. It continues its conspiracies and strives to further its evil plots in its new life.
You can turn an existing evil, living, spellcasting creature into a worm that walks using the following steps. Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the aberration and swarm traits and usually remains evil. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Reduce its Hit Points by the amount listed on the table (to a minimum of 2 HP per level). The worm that walks gains fast healing, resistance to physical damage, and weakness to area damage and splash damage as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the worm that walks has fewer HP.
Starting LevelHP DecreaseFast Healing, Resistance, and Weakness 4 or less-205 5-7-307 8-14-4010 15 or higher-6015
A worm that walks loses any abilities that came from its previous physical form and any traits that represent its life, such as human and humanoid. It retains any spellcasting abilities it had in life, regardless of their origin, and gains the abilities listed below. You might need to adjust other abilities that conflict with the monster’s new theme as a worm that walks.
Darkvision
Tremorsense 30 feet (imprecise)
Immunities All worms that walk have immunity to disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, and unconscious. They also have the swarm mind ability, which makes them immune to mental effects that target a specific number of creatures, though they are still subject to mental effects that affect all creatures in an area.
All-Around Vision
Discorporate When the worm that walks is reduced to 0 HP, it discorporates and the component worms that make up its body disperse in every direction. If even a single worm escapes, the worm that walks will eventually re-form using a process that typically takes 1d10 days.
While the exact circumstances and surroundings determine how long the worm that walks’s foes have to dispatch the fleeing worms before they escape, usually its foes have only a single round. Typically, this requires the application of an area effect or splash weapon within 1 round to the space where the worm that walks collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing the damage must attempt a DC 15 flat check. Each subsequent area or splash damage effect performed on the area reduces the DC of this flat check by 2, to a minimum of DC 5. If any of these flat checks succeed, none of the worms escape, and the worm that walks is destroyed permanently. At the GM’s discretion, clever means of trapping or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to finish off the worm that walks.
Tendril Regardless of the creature’s former anatomy, it gains a tendril melee Strike with reach that deals persistent piercing damage as it leaves biting worms on the target. If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its tendril should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its tendril should deal three-quarters of that damage.
Squirming Embrace The worm that walks Strides, ending its movement sharing a space with a creature, and deals piercing damage to the creature equal to 1d8 plus an additional 1d8 for every 3 levels the worm that walks has. The creature can attempt a basic Reflex save with a DC of the worm that walks’s spell DC – 2.
Swarm Shape (concentrate) The worm that walks collapses into a shapeless swarm of worms. It drops all held, worn, and carried items. While discorporated, the worm that walks can’t use attack actions and can’t cast spells, but it can move through areas small enough for its individual worms to fit without having to Squeeze. It can use the same action to coalesce back into its normal form.
While worms are the most common type of creature to form the composite body of a worm that walks, other verminous variations are possible. Cockroaches: A worm that walks made of cockroaches gains a +1 bonus to AC and light blindness.Leeches: A worm that walks made of leeches gains a swim Speed of 25 feet, but its land Speed is 10 feet.Spiders: A worm that walks made of spiders gains a climb Speed equal to half its land Speed, and half the damage from its Squirming Embrace is poison damage.
In rare situations, once a spellcaster rises as a worm that walks it might recant its evil ways, given the right influence and enough time. Many of these worms that walk seek self-destruction, not out of abhorrence at their new form but at the realization of the evils they wrought while alive. Others, though, take advantage of their second chance and use their new life to help undo the ruin and horror they might have afflicted upon the world in their prior existence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Wraith.
Wraiths are malevolent undead who drain life and shun light. Their shadowy, incorporeal forms are dotted with burning eyes that reffect their hatred for the living, and shadowy claws are weapon enough to steal the vitality from their enemies. A wraith may be created by foul necromancy, but more often they are the result of a hermitic murderer or mutilator who even in death could not give up their wicked ways. Further complicating the matter is the fact that wraiths multiply by consuming and transforming the living into more of their foul kind—meaning a handful of wraiths left unchecked can easily turn into a horde of darkness.
Wraiths weigh nothing and are unharmed by most physical attacks. They haunt any place where they can feed on the living, though their vulnerability to sunlight confines them to the shadowy places of the world—places where they can blend in seamlessly with their dark surroundings before silently engulfing their prey.
Wraiths may form packs with others of their kind in places where death and mayhem are commonplace—countrysides ravaged by war, metropolitan underworlds run by criminal overlords, or sites of fiendish cultic rituals. In these places, the living do well to tread with sunrods and powerful clerics in tow. Ruins, sewers, and abandoned buildings provide sanctuary for wraiths during the day, as the creatures hunt exclusively at night or in dark places. Wraiths are smart enough to take advantage of their incorporeality in combat, so they keep to tortuous caverns or structures with hallways and avoid open areas.
As they’re formed purely of anti-life from the Negative Energy Plane, wraiths pervade that unholy realm. Within nations and civilizations ruled by the undead, wraiths have places of power as assassins and spies. They’re among the ruling class in Geb, but have greater numbers in Ustalav, where packs of wraiths roam graveyards and misty trails, consuming the populations of entire villages. In other parts of the world, wraiths tend not to wander and limit their activity to smaller environs, typically just the site of their chosen haunting and its immediate surroundings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Wyrmwraith.
Wyrmwraiths rise from the souls of dragons who refuse to accept death or have an irrational fear of the afterlife.
The most powerful of these monsters, elder wyrmwraiths, sometimes form spontaneously from legendary dragons who were haunted with an irrational fear of the afterlife, but most are wyrmwraiths who have grown in power during an existence of well over a thousand years. The most powerful wyrmwraiths survive for millennia, typically by hiding away in remote caverns or wastelands and enacting their far-reaching plots through proxies. Some elder wyrmwraiths dedicate themselves to the pursuit of learning, but typically the only knowledge they crave is that which grants advantages against their enemies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Wyvern.
A wyvern is a venomous drake with a well-earned reputation for impatience and aggression. As much as 15 feet long and weighing up to 1,000 pounds, a wyvern’s resilient body allows it to crash talons-first into large prey without serious risk to itself. A wyvern uses its momentum to stun its target before injecting it with searing venom or carrying it over the side of a nearby cliff. Because a wyvern lacks the strength to haul its prey all the way to its nest intact, it is far more likely to lift and drop its victim over a gully or canyon and let gravity do its work before it descends to pick apart the carcass.
Conversation is of little interest to a wyvern, as the creature typically speaks only to taunt its prey, issue territorial claims, or demand tribute. Even so, many wyverns enjoy grim humor and tales of violent acts, particularly if those acts were committed by the storyteller. A wyvern properly appeased with meat, entertainment, and treasure sometimes agrees to provide assistance ranging from giving directions to serving as a mount for a powerful humanoid. However, these arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks before the wyvern’s pride, malice, or insolence inspires it to flee or even betray its allies. Only the truly cruel can cow a wyvern into servitude for an extended period, as most wyverns are so self-interested that they go out of their way to avoid helping others.
Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.
While drake hides aren’t any more valuable than those of other, similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. While they are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.
A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.
A drake egg has Hardness 3, 5 HP, and BT 5. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.
Once a drake hatches, it imprints on the first creature that it sees. A creature imprinted on in this way gains a +5 bonus to Nature checks to train or command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the region, the type of drake, and the exact purpose the buyer has in mind, but typically depends on the level of the drake. Because drakes are evil, dangerous, and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.
It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconfidence, or general lack of skill.
Drakes reach maturity and reproduce much earlier than dragons, meaning that they are a far more common threat than their more powerful forebears. Drakes have few qualms about dwelling with one another (provided they are the same species), often establishing dens in pockets of wilderness suitable to their needs, such as swampy grottoes, shallow shoreline caves, or cliffside perches.
The allure of hunting a dragon is difficult to resist for many adventurers, but accomplishing such a task is fraught with peril. Unscrupulous adventurers have been known to instead hunt drakes and use trophies harvested from these creatures to deceive locals.
While the different species of drakes are adapted to different climates and environments, many drakes share similar preferences regarding nest location, searching out high places that offer cover from above, such as cliffside or mountaintop caverns, jungle canopies, and so on.
While every adventurer knows that dragon hide can be crafted into potent armor or weapons, drake hide holds no such intrinsic value. Nonetheless, drake scales and horns are physically impressive, and to the uneducated buyer, might seem at first glance to be legitimate. Unscrupulous leatherworkers have been known to use drake hides to craft and sell counterfeit dragonhide armor, so potential buyers should remain on the lookout for scams.
Drakes share dragon’s interest in treasure, but lack dragons’ discerning taste. A drake hoard will certainly contain coins, jewelry, gemstones, gear, and even the odd magic item or two, but the bulk of the hoard invariably consists of broken weapons, shiny rocks, bits of junk, and other doubtful pieces of refuse.
Although drakes and dragons are related to one another, little love is lost between them, and even the most territorial drakes know better than to remain in a dragon's territory longer than they have to. In rare cases, large rampages of drakes band together to attack an encroaching dragon, especially if the dragon is young and inexperienced.
The drakes presented on these pages are far from the only types that exist. Forest drakes have green hides, spit acidic clouds, and can be found in temperate woodlands. Rift drakes, among the most powerful of their kind, spit clinging caustic vapors and dwell in badlands and regions scarred by devastating magical disasters. Sea drakes can be found in oceans across the world, lava drakes in volcanic crevasses, mist drakes along coastlines and in salt marshes, and spire drakes in ragged, rocky hills. Undoubtedly, many other types of drakes lurk in the far corners of the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Xill.
Xills visit the Material Plane, where they're often known as ethereal stalkers, primarily to maraud and to kidnap creatures back to their native Ethereal Plane. These four-armed, warmongering monsters paralyze their victims before implanting them with eggs using an ovipositor normally kept retracted behind their mandibles. Their single-minded drive to expand and conquer is so all-encompassing that while they work together dutifully and without dissent, there is little else in their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Xilvirek.
Xilvireks are the result of the strange evolution that takes place in Zevgavizeb’s Abyssal realm. These fiends resemble their dread demon lord and claim to be living embodiments of the Lord of Reptiles’s snapping jaws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Xorn.
These squat, rotund elementals have three legs, three arms, three eyes, and one massive maw, which they fill with the gems and metals they find so delicious.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Earth elementals sometimes have valuable gemstones or minerals incorporated into their bodies, and once they are slain, these valuables can be scavenged as treasure. Gemstones, precious metals such as silver or gold ore, or rarer materials such as mithral or adamantine can be harvested from these creatures, although the more expensive finds tend to be incorporated into only the most powerful earth elementals.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Xotanispawn.
Xotanispawn are monstrous versions of scavenging beetle larvae that have been corrupted and mutated by feeding on the remains of Xotani the Firebleeder, a slain Spawn of Rovagug buried beneath Pale Mountain in Katapesh. These creatures look vaguely like the minute insects they once were, with a sclerotized head and chitinous body plates, six legs, and numerous dorsal spines lining the joints and edges of each segment. However, by feeding on the unholy remains of Xotani, the spawn have manifested many of the traits of the infamous Firebleeder, most notably a blisteringly hot internal temperature and powerful fire attacks—to say nothing of their monstrous size.
Internal heat radiates from every surface of a Xotanispawn, even from its mouth. Any contact with a Xotanispawn results in burns and the risk of catching on fire. Thankfully, Xotanispawn have also inherited Xotani’s weaknesses to cold and sunlight. They are rarely encountered on the surface during the day, opting to emerge from their subterranean lairs only at night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Xotani, The Firebleeder.
A monstrosity of living flame and magma, Xotani may be the weakest of Rovagug’s spawn, but it remains a formidable threat. Xotani was slain in 2104 ar by an alliance of spellcasters, but recently its deathlike slumber was interrupted. Its corpse twitches, signaling that it might be close to returning.
All spawn of Rovagug can sleep for centuries and do not need to eat, drink, or even breathe while hibernating. While hibernating, a spawn’s resistances double in value. It cannot be located by divination effects, and for any saving throw, it uses the outcome for one degree of success better than the result.
A spawn of Rovagug has regeneration powerful enough to revive it even if slain by a death effect. If the spawn fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 Hit Point. It can be banished, imprisoned, or transported away as a means to save a region, or kept in a state of dying by an effect that deals constant damage. A complex and expensive ritual culminating in a word that douses Xotani’s flames can be used to deactivate its regeneration, but no method of deactivating Tarrasque’s regeneration has yet been discovered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Xulgath Bilebearer.
While many xulgaths impose their will by strength or sheer numbers, some resort to more nefarious—and grotesque—means to take care of matters. The bilebearer takes its name from its eponymous bile, a putrid substance that oozes from gill-like folds in its colorful, bulging neck. Bilebearers coat their weapons with the viscous substance or secrete a concentrated dose that suffuses the air around them and disables foes.
A bilebearer’s neck bulges with folds of scaled flesh that extend almost to the creature’s shoulders, containing its namesake bile productions glands inside. These folds expand and contract with each breath, and each fold has a vertical line of muscled pores that gradually exudes the thick substance, providing a perpetual supply for coating weapons. Bilebearers’ necks also contain inflatable bladders, which they can quickly pressurize to expel a blast of vaporized bile in a noxious, overwhelming cloud.
Bilebearers serve their clutches by kidnapping or slaying specific enemies. They frequently accompany their kin, particularly xulgath skulkers, to raid rival clutches or intercept foes. A bilebearer’s mode of attack typically involves sneaking in, overwhelming any guards with a noxious blast of bile, and then turning their attention to the primary target. The xulgath either shreds the rapidly weakening victim on the spot or drags them away for future violence.
Although today the xulgaths are brutal and scattered, they were one of the first intelligent humanoids to rise in the primeval world, once ruling over a mighty empire that stretched throughout the Darklands. Today, all that remains of this era are ruins of massive stone ziggurats and crumbling cities found within some of the larger caverns. Some groups of xulgaths continue to live among these ruins, venerating their ancestors’ accomplishments, while others consider these areas taboo and leave them to become infested with Darklands vermin. Sages don’t agree on why the ancient xulgath civilization fell. Some suspect it was the result of a loss of several wars waged against serpentfolk, while others suggest that the corruptive influence of demon worship rotted their culture from within.
Certainly, many xulgath settlements continue to worship demons to this day, paying homage and offering live sacrifices to terrible creatures from the Abyss. Occasionally, a xulgath shaman can call forth and bind a lesser demon to help serve the group, but a shaman who delves too deep into occultism might summon a more powerful fiend that either tears the xulgaths to pieces or enslaves them.
Zevgavizeb is the most popular deity among xulgaths—particularly in the largest and most successful clutches—but other demon lords and deities are worshipped as well. Among Golarion's major gods, Pharasma, Rovagug, and even Erastil are known to answer the prayers of xulgath devotees.
Xulgaths respect strength, and the leader of a community is usually the strongest of all of them. The leader’s dominance is rarely questioned until a potentially stronger xulgath believes it’s time for a change in rulership. The two xulgaths then face off in a fight to the death, with the victor claiming rule.
Xulgaths are relatively primitive, using tools and weapons of stone and other materials scavenged from the surface. These can replicate most simple and a few martial melee weapons, as well as simple thrown ranged weapons. An advanced tribe of xulgaths might be able to craft low-level magical talismans, such as a potency crystal or a returning clasp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Xulgath Deepmouth.
Xulgath deepmouths wield the powers of the Abyss against their clutch's enemies and invoke righteous fear in their followers. The vast majority of deepmouths worship demon lords, most commonly Zevgavizeb. Scalescribing—the warping of xulgath flesh into imitations of Abyssal script—is a widespread practice among deepmouths, enabling them to channel the power of the Abyss through their fanatical devotees' own bodies.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Xulgath Gutrager.
Xulgath gutragers exhibit more extreme developments along the same physiological path as their bilebearer cousins. They are stockier and faster, with necks and limbs corded with muscle. They are also denser, with multiple stomachs full of fluids even more caustic than those of the bilebearer. Like the bilebearer, gutragers lack the distinctive stench typical of most xulgaths.
A gutrager’s torso conceals its most disturbing feature—a densely coiled esophagus. Pressurized bladders and a muscular throat allow the gutrager to propel its esophagus outward in an explosion of yellow flesh and acidic bile; caustic stomach acid coating the esophagus makes even brief physical contact with the organ dangerous. As a last resort, the gutrager can intentionally accelerate the corrosion in its esophagus, releasing vile acid in a burst that also ends its life.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Xulgath Leader.
Xulgath leaders are usually the strongest, most violent members of a community—although in some cases, particularly in larger groups, xulgath tribes are led by powerful demon cultists or other monsters who seek to use the xulgaths as servants or slaves.

Xulgath warrens are patrolled—some might say “haunted”—by the community’s skulkers. These xulgaths specialize in stealth, striking swiftly from the shadows and otherwise ambushing foes.

Some groups of xulgaths continue to live among these ruins, venerating their ancestors’ accomplishments, while others consider these areas taboo and leave them to become infested with Darklands vermin. Sages don’t agree on why the ancient xulgath civilization fell. Some suspect it was the result of a loss of several wars waged against serpentfolk, while others suggest that the corruptive influence of demon worship rotted their culture from within.
Certainly, many xulgath settlements continue to worship demons to this day, paying homage and offering live sacrifices to terrible creatures from the Abyss. Occasionally, a xulgath shaman can call forth and bind a lesser demon to help serve the group, but a shaman who delves too deep into occultism might summon a more powerful fiend that either tears the xulgaths to pieces or enslaves them.
Zevgavizeb is the most popular deity among xulgaths—particularly in the largest and most successful clutches—but other demon lords and deities are worshipped as well. Among Golarion's major gods, Pharasma, Rovagug, and even Erastil are known to answer the prayers of xulgath devotees.
Xulgaths respect strength, and the leader of a community is usually the strongest of all of them. The leader’s dominance is rarely questioned until a potentially stronger xulgath believes it’s time for a change in rulership. The two xulgaths then face off in a fight to the death, with the victor claiming rule.
Xulgaths are relatively primitive, using tools and weapons of stone and other materials scavenged from the surface. These can replicate most simple and a few martial melee weapons, as well as simple thrown ranged weapons. An advanced tribe of xulgaths might be able to craft low-level magical talismans, such as a potency crystal or a returning clasp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Xulgath Spinesnapper.
Xulgath physiological diversity doesn’t always imply drastic change; some xulgaths are simply much larger and stronger than their clutchmates. Most xulgaths call such siblings spinesnappers, though terms like bonebreaker, marrowvent, or similarly violent epithets are equally common. A typical spinesnapper is 9 feet tall and weighs 350 pounds.
In battle, spinesnappers have all the speed, grace, and strength of a sledgehammer. They are ideal shock troops and make a good first line of defense. When an inter-clutch conflict leads to a duel, spinesnappers are typically called upon to rise to the challenge. In this case, a spinesnapper representative from each clutch squares off for what is in theory a nonlethal wrestling match, after which the winner scrapes off some of the loser’s scales as a trophy.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Xulgath Stoneliege.
Stonelieges are xulgaths magically infused with living earth—the very bones of the world. They are created through a process xulgaths call stone-binding, which can be performed with complex alchemy, powerful psychic magic, or Abyssal rituals. Their scales are like stone slabs, and their bones are as dense as bedrock, so they are among the hardiest and longest-lived xulgaths. To stonelieges, earth is as mutable as water, and their innate power to shape the soil and stone beneath their feet makes them integral members of xulgath society (as well as formidable combatants).

<|startoftext|>Describe a Xulgath Thoughtmaw.
Xulgath thoughtmaws are inheritors of the xulgaths' ancient psychic legacy. They eagerly and liberally use their ability to extract knowledge from their foes to quicken their own prodigious intellects.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Xulgath Warrior.
Xulgath warriors strike with fury and eager cruelty, always ready for the next fight. The taking of prizes from battle—including weapons and items stolen from defeated foes along with grislier trophies harvested from fallen victims’ flesh—is a popular pursuit among these vicious reptiles, and those whose armor and scales are most adorned are awarded the greatest respect (and perhaps fear) from their kin.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Yaganty.
Yaganties are lean, hairy humanoids with lanky torsos, horned heads, and bulbous black eyes. The elongated fingers of one their hands are made of candlestick wax, and their fingertips, which have wicks instead of nails, burn endlessly. In the dead of night, the flickering light of a yaganty’s fingertips casts dramatic shadows across their face and highlights their trollish visage.
Yaganty fables follow a common formula. A wayward pedestrian, traveling at night and usually in a forest, follows distant lights with the hope that the lights belong to a fellow wayfarer, only to come face-to-face with a gangly monster. The story ends in one of three ways: the traveler appeals to the yaganty with a gift of gold (the exact sum necessary varies wildly by the telling), the yaganty slays the traveler over some incomprehensible transgression, or, even more inexplicably, the yaganty offers the lost traveler five candles in simple charity so that the light might guide them home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Yamaraj.
The greatest judges among the psychopomps are the massive yamarajes, whose wisdom is legendary and whose edicts are unappealable except to ushers or Pharasma herself. A yamaraj resembles an immense dragon with dark, feathery scales and an emotionless, dispassionate gaze behind a feathered mask. When not serving as the senior magistrates, lords, and generals of the Boneyard, yamarajes pursue highly individualistic hobbies, such as gardening or literature. They are willing to halt in their duties to converse with mortals whose expertise matches their interests.
Nosois and morrignas are far from the only of their kind. Many others, like the skeletal vanths or the draconic yamarajes, also aid in the stewardship of the dead.
Psychopomps rarely oppose celestials or fiends. In fact, they frequently host such creatures in the Boneyard, particularly in the sprawling psychopomp courts where these outsiders petition for one soul or another to be remanded to their jurisdiction. Complicated cases are judged by yamarajes, while the thorniest or most politically delicate are handed by Pharasma herself.
Psychopomps' greatest enemies are creatures that devour or steal souls, such as astradaemons and night hags. Their other opponents include necromancers, proteans, and those who have unnaturally extended their lifespan, such as liches.
Some psychopomps view their task of sorting souls as ultimately hollow and meaningless, since the multiverse itself must one day end. Eons ago, these rebels shirked their duties and fled to the empty corners of the planes, becoming a new type of evil creature called a sahkil. Sahkils feed on mortal fears, particularly fears of death, and enjoy tormenting those who must die. Psychopomps generally leave these malcontents alone, except when sahkils interfere with the proper flow of souls.
The most powerful of the psychopomps are unique demigods known collectively as “ushers,” each of whom has its own cult. These psychopomp divinities include Atropos, the Last Sister; Barzahk, the Passage; Ceyanan, the Shepherd; Dammar, the Denied; Imot, the Symbol of Doom; Mother Vulture, the Flesheater; Mrtyu, Death's Consort; Narakas, the Cleansing Sentence; the Pale Horse; Phlegyas, Consoler of Atheists; Saloc, Minder of Immortals; Teshallas, the Primordial Poison; and Vale, the Court of the Ancestors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Yellow Musk Brute.
A creature transformed by a yellow musk creeper's tendrils boring into its brain becomes a yellow musk thrall if it's Small or Medium, or a yellow musk brute if Large (a Small creature becomes a Small thrall rather than a Medium one). The transformation takes 1 hour. A yellow musk thrall takes only the most rudimentary of actions: bringing the yellow musk creeper water and new creatures to infest. After a few days (or if the creeper dies), the thrall wanders off into the wilderness and falls dead within 24 hours. The body of a deceased thrall sprouts a new yellow musk creeper within hours of its death, becoming a fully grown plant within 24 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Yellow Musk Creeper.
Made up of thick, green vines with numerous yellow flowers, the yellow musk creeper grows at places where the ground is enriched with spilled blood and corpses, like battlefields and graveyards. An ideal environment for the yellow musk creeper isn't inhabited, but draws occasional humanoid visitors the plant can transform into thralls. The yellow musk creeper enraptures creatures with its bright yellow pollen to bring them close. It then physically alters their brains with its tendrils, implanting a seed in each to turn the creatures into mindless thralls. The yellow musk creeper might try to take over a sleeping creature, but it lacks the faculties to sneak up on anyone, and is likely to wake victims before it can drag itself close enough.
The plant's pollen can spread far on the wind but quickly becomes too diffuse to cause harm. Wilderness scouts learn to sniff out the distinctive musky scent of the pollen, which stays potent even in harmless quantities. A sprouting creeper is also easy to detect, since it grows from the rotting, messy corpse of a thrall creature.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Describe a Yeth Hound.
Wicked canine creatures who live for the thrill of the hunt, yeth hounds often serve evil masters as guardians and trackers. Yeth hounds resemble lean, sleek dogs with overlarge ears and narrow paws that can tread on air as easily as the ground. Despite their canine appearance, yeth hounds are remarkably intelligent, although they rarely display this intelligence except when devising intricate tactics to ensnare their quarry. Their eerie bays echo across the countryside when they are engaged in a hunt, and they particularly enjoy baying to frighten and disorient intelligent creatures. Yeth hound packs can number as many as a dozen members, each working in uncanny communion with its packmates to corner and kill their prey. Yeth hounds like to drag their victims back to their lairs to eat at their leisure, so these lairs often contain discarded treasures from the hounds' previous meals.
Yeth hounds despise two things: sunlight and other canines. They hunt only at night if they can, often breaking off their hunt at dawn to retreat to a subterranean lair or den, no matter how close they had come to catching their prey. Yeth hounds usually attack wargs, wolves, and similar creatures on sight, working to drive larger or more powerful canines from their hunting areas when then can't simply overpower and kill them.
Evil rangers, bestial demons, and wicked cults are frequently gifted yeth hound servants by fiendish patrons. Such hounds often serve as spies and are quick to turn against those who fail to advance the patrons' wicked aims. The cult of Lamashtu, in particular, is fond of using yeth hounds as temple guardians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Yeti.
Nearly a myth, the yeti is rarely seen—and even when it is, it is often too late. Yetis dwell amid the highest, most remote peaks of the world, coming down from their snowy mountain holds to raid, steal livestock, and sometimes feed their insatiable urges for slaughter and destruction. Those folks who live at the foot of a yeti-ruled mountain warn of the “abominable snowmen”: monstrous, fur-covered humanoids who leave strange and bloody tracks in the snow.
Normally yetis seek to protect the world rather than hunt its other civilized denizens. They do so by lairing near eldritch portals that form links between the Material Plane and other, much stranger dimensions of reality. From within these snow-covered arches and ancient stone doorways, aliens, living nightmares, fiends, and worse can emerge through dimensional networks into the world. Yetis who guard these portals sometimes succumb to these horrors and are corrupted, taking on the bloodthirsty urges and horrific behaviors of the very monsters they strive to protect the world against. Yetis who manifest such violent tendencies are driven out of their clan and forced to wander the mountaintops alone, thus giving rise to the myth of the legendary abominable snowman. Forced to fend for themselves, these exiled yetis often fully embrace the corrupting elements that caused their exile in the first place, growing more powerful and more deadly as a result. The most vile of these yetis turn to cannibalism, not out of need, but out of a sheer joy at the terror they inflict upon their kin. Invariably such cannibalistic yetis attract the attention of wendigos, which makes a bad situation all the worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Young Black Dragon.
Murderous tyrants of marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens, black dragons terrorize their domains with intense fervor. Gleefully sadistic, they rule their fetid principalities from a deep cave or otherwise isolated part of the swamp with a mix of lightning-quick raids and subterfuge. Their hatred for other creatures is as acidic as their breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons of their kind—except perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual enemy.
Black dragons are amphibious—although they breathe air, their gills also allow them to breathe water. Their frills and fins make them accomplished swimmers, well suited to their wetland environments and submerged lairs. They’re immune to the fetid water that comes as a result of their magical ability to corrupt water.
Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The floors are littered with rotting meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes, and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer substance can’t survive the dragon’s acidic presence.
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Each type of chromatic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a chromatic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.
The chromatic dragons that dwell around the Inner Sea region are cruel and sinister monsters who inspire as much fear as reverence. These terrible beasts are no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic and metallic dragons.
Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Young Blue Dragon.
Blue dragons are the sleek and poised cosmopolitans of the chromatic dragons. Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon’s lackeys typically don’t even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.
Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they’re universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.
Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.
The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon’s true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel— expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Young Brass Dragon.
Brass dragons are whimsical tricksters who delight in humor and play. They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society—networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.
These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don’t harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.
Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon’s prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.
Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals’ lives—and of their passing—always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don’t seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water—though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.
In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts (page 104–115), other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-fiung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation); The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage modifiers with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Each type of metallic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that kind. To make a metallic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.
Metallic dragons are found throughout the Inner Sea region, especially in pockets of wilderness where they can carve a hideout and then take action on political and social issues, both in their local area and on a wider scale. Their everlasting war with chromatic dragons keeps them in close proximity to their evil brethren; in regions where metallic and chromatic dragons’ territories intersect, humanoid settlements get caught in the crossfire, and villagers and city-dwellers alike rightfully fear for their own safety.
Silver dragons lair in abundance around the cold wastes west of Mendev, as a consequence of the days when they joined thousands of crusaders who marched headlong into the demon-infested Worldwound. Bronze dragons are abundant in Taldor, and many copper dragons lair in the wilds of Andoran, where they wage war alongside other freedom fighters to overthrow devils in the neighboring empire of Cheliax. Perhaps the most extreme example of a metallic dragon taking part in human affairs is on the island nation of Hermea, where Mengkare—an ancient gold wyrm—has begun a grand social experiment he calls “the Glorious Endeavor.” Ostensibly intended to create a future utopia on Golarion, this highly controversial experiment is instead regarded by many as a cruel and unusual form of eugenics.

Brine dragons are usually blue-green in color, with shiny scales, crests that help them glide through the water, and sweeping neck frills. They care little for either good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.
Depending on the dragon's personality, their community members might view their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.
Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed, or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged from sunken ships.
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an affinity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor arcane or divine magic. Although they come from distant planes, primal dragons can be found on the Material Plane in regions touched by or reminiscent of their home plane. Although such encounters are rare, adventurers and travelers have sometimes found a brine dragon dwelling near a salty inland sea, for example, or a crystal dragon living in massive natural caverns deep in the Darklands. Unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, primal dragons tend not to develop shape-changing powers, and they are less interested in infiltrating settlements or influencing others from the shadows.
Each type of primal dragon features a note in the margins on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a primal dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other primal spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Wisdom or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect their mastery of magic.
Golarion is not home to many primal dragons. Yet primal dragons do still come to Golarion now and then, whether to escape persecution in their home plane, build new lairs, torment and brutalize weaker creatures, or seek knowledge and resources that are scarce or unavailable at home.
Brine dragons can be found along Golarion’s coastlines but are often frustrated by piracy and other lawless elements. They tend to avoid heavily populated coastal areas like the Shackles and instead choose remote islands in the oceans as their homes, where they can rule small communities of their own curation. Cloud dragons are even more isolated, and lacking any interest in politics, they prefer to dwell in large mountain ranges like the Kodars or the Barrier Wall. Crystal dragons’ vanity compels them to seek places that complement their natural beauty, such as gem-studded caverns in the Darklands. Of all the primal dragons, cantankerous magma dragons may be the ones most often found dwelling on Golarion, where they are drawn to volcanic ranges like the Five Kings Mountains. Umbral dragons hail not from an Elemental Plane but the Shadow Plane, and they can be encountered anywhere the borders to that plane grow thin, particularly in the sinister nation of Nidal.
Brine dragon spellcasters tend to cast the following spells.

A series of underwater caverns on Thoska Isle in the Ironbound Archipelago serves as Rezlarabren's lair. There she rules a tribe of ulat-kini who labor as miners. Her relationship with the Linnorm Kings is complex, and whether she views them as allies or enemies depends on her mood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Young Bronze Dragon.
Bronze dragons are among the most common of metallic dragons and the most likely to ally with mortals on worthy quests. However, they are naturally scholarly creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists, guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.
Bronze dragons’ mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon’s enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.
While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library—with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals’ lives—and of their passing—always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don’t seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water—though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.
In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts (page 104–115), other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-fiung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation); The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage modifiers with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Each type of metallic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that kind. To make a metallic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.
Metallic dragons are found throughout the Inner Sea region, especially in pockets of wilderness where they can carve a hideout and then take action on political and social issues, both in their local area and on a wider scale. Their everlasting war with chromatic dragons keeps them in close proximity to their evil brethren; in regions where metallic and chromatic dragons’ territories intersect, humanoid settlements get caught in the crossfire, and villagers and city-dwellers alike rightfully fear for their own safety.
Silver dragons lair in abundance around the cold wastes west of Mendev, as a consequence of the days when they joined thousands of crusaders who marched headlong into the demon-infested Worldwound. Bronze dragons are abundant in Taldor, and many copper dragons lair in the wilds of Andoran, where they wage war alongside other freedom fighters to overthrow devils in the neighboring empire of Cheliax. Perhaps the most extreme example of a metallic dragon taking part in human affairs is on the island nation of Hermea, where Mengkare—an ancient gold wyrm—has begun a grand social experiment he calls “the Glorious Endeavor.” Ostensibly intended to create a future utopia on Golarion, this highly controversial experiment is instead regarded by many as a cruel and unusual form of eugenics.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Young Cloud Dragon.
At heart, cloud dragons are wanderers, explorers, and travelers who enjoy nothing more than seeing new lands and meeting unusual creatures. Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.
A cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw—they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.
Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a cloud dragon, a diversified hoard is a perfect hoard.
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an affinity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor arcane or divine magic.

While most cloud dragons prefer solitude and avoid confrontations, Zanembis is an excellent example of how failed dragonslaying attempts can create problems. Previously content to dwell atop Angel Peak in the Mindspin Mountains, this cloud dragon has grown vengeful and violent in the wake of unexpected and unjustified attacks on his lair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Young Copper Dragon.
Capricious and always eager to share a good laugh, copper dragons are among the wiliest of the metallic dragons, but this by no means interferes with their mission to spread freedom in oppressive lands. Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they’re also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.
Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.
A copper dragon’s combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless with laughter.
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals’ lives—and of their passing—always spread far and wide.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Young Crystal Dragon.
Good-natured but vain, crystal dragons are beautiful creatures with brilliant hides made of multicolored crystal and gemstone. Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.
Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.
Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to find evil creatures uncouth and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature's capacity for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that crystal dragons hunger for).

She has taken on a somewhat unusual role as a shopkeeper in that city's necropolis, where she's eager to trade magic items she's collected for more gems and valuable stones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Young Gold Dragon.
Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.
When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.
A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.
Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals’ lives—and of their passing—always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don’t seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Young Green Dragon.
Green dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon’s fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.
Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.
Green dragons’ pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.
Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Each type of chromatic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a chromatic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.
The chromatic dragons that dwell around the Inner Sea region are cruel and sinister monsters who inspire as much fear as reverence. These terrible beasts are no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic and metallic dragons.
Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Young Magma Dragon.
Magma dragons have a reputation among other dragons for being unpredictable and brash. Their temperament and tendency for violent outbursts ensure that the typical magma dragon lives a solitary life, with hatchlings often bickering or fighting to establish dominance among themselves before they leave the nest. A magma dragon always has a reason for their outbursts and can always justify their sudden turns in mood, yet they rarely feel the need to do so.
Magma dragons build lairs within volcanically active mountains or deep underground amid vast lakes of bubbling magma. As with all true dragons, magma dragons keep hoards of treasure, but the nature of their searing lairs limits the type of valuables they collect to metals, gems, and items capable of resisting the heat of a volcano's core.
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an affinity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor arcane or divine magic. Although they come from distant planes, primal dragons can be found on the Material Plane in regions touched by or reminiscent of their home plane. Although such encounters are rare, adventurers and travelers have sometimes found a brine dragon dwelling near a salty inland sea, for example, or a crystal dragon living in massive natural caverns deep in the Darklands. Unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, primal dragons tend not to develop shape-changing powers, and they are less interested in infiltrating settlements or influencing others from the shadows.
Each type of primal dragon features a note in the margins on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a primal dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other primal spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Wisdom or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect their mastery of magic.
Golarion is not home to many primal dragons. Yet primal dragons do still come to Golarion now and then, whether to escape persecution in their home plane, build new lairs, torment and brutalize weaker creatures, or seek knowledge and resources that are scarce or unavailable at home.
Brine dragons can be found along Golarion’s coastlines but are often frustrated by piracy and other lawless elements. They tend to avoid heavily populated coastal areas like the Shackles and instead choose remote islands in the oceans as their homes, where they can rule small communities of their own curation. Cloud dragons are even more isolated, and lacking any interest in politics, they prefer to dwell in large mountain ranges like the Kodars or the Barrier Wall. Crystal dragons’ vanity compels them to seek places that complement their natural beauty, such as gem-studded caverns in the Darklands. Of all the primal dragons, cantankerous magma dragons may be the ones most often found dwelling on Golarion, where they are drawn to volcanic ranges like the Five Kings Mountains. Umbral dragons hail not from an Elemental Plane but the Shadow Plane, and they can be encountered anywhere the borders to that plane grow thin, particularly in the sinister nation of Nidal.
Magma dragon spellcasters tend to cast the following spells.
The ancient magma dragon Moschabbatt dwells in a vast chamber hidden within Droskar's Crag, the largest volcano in the Inner Sea region. Rumor holds that the dragon counts at least one legendary dwarven artifact among the priceless treasures of his vast hoard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Young Red Dragon.
The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons are a menace to civilizations everywhere, and their strength is rivaled only by their arrogance. Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering frame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes—only unquestioned fact.
Red dragons don’t deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon’s security.
Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals—or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance.
As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous places, with volcanoes being a favorite spot, as they find them foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable. No matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and other treasures, which they zealously guard. Sometimes, the dragon’s internal heat causes these precious metals to fuse together.
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Each type of chromatic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a chromatic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.
The chromatic dragons that dwell around the Inner Sea region are cruel and sinister monsters who inspire as much fear as reverence. These terrible beasts are no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic and metallic dragons.
Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Young Silver Dragon.
Silver dragons are among the most chivalrous of all dragonkind; they wield frost and cold as weapons, can walk on clouds, and dwell high upon snowy mountain peaks or deep in steep, misty valleys. Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.
Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.
Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.
Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals’ lives—and of their passing—always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don’t seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water—though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.
In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts (page 104–115), other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-fiung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation); The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage modifiers with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Each type of metallic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that kind. To make a metallic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic.
Metallic dragons are found throughout the Inner Sea region, especially in pockets of wilderness where they can carve a hideout and then take action on political and social issues, both in their local area and on a wider scale. Their everlasting war with chromatic dragons keeps them in close proximity to their evil brethren; in regions where metallic and chromatic dragons’ territories intersect, humanoid settlements get caught in the crossfire, and villagers and city-dwellers alike rightfully fear for their own safety.
Silver dragons lair in abundance around the cold wastes west of Mendev, as a consequence of the days when they joined thousands of crusaders who marched headlong into the demon-infested Worldwound. Bronze dragons are abundant in Taldor, and many copper dragons lair in the wilds of Andoran, where they wage war alongside other freedom fighters to overthrow devils in the neighboring empire of Cheliax. Perhaps the most extreme example of a metallic dragon taking part in human affairs is on the island nation of Hermea, where Mengkare—an ancient gold wyrm—has begun a grand social experiment he calls “the Glorious Endeavor.” Ostensibly intended to create a future utopia on Golarion, this highly controversial experiment is instead regarded by many as a cruel and unusual form of eugenics.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Young Umbral Dragon.
While the other primal dragons hail from the Elemental Planes, the cruel and unceasingly malicious umbral dragons originate in the depths of the Shadow Plane. Their sleek black scales and serpentine grace allow them to strike from hiding, and they are known for playing with their prey before finally finishing it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.
For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an affinity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor arcane or divine magic. Although they come from distant planes, primal dragons can be found on the Material Plane in regions touched by or reminiscent of their home plane. Although such encounters are rare, adventurers and travelers have sometimes found a brine dragon dwelling near a salty inland sea, for example, or a crystal dragon living in massive natural caverns deep in the Darklands. Unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, primal dragons tend not to develop shape-changing powers, and they are less interested in infiltrating settlements or influencing others from the shadows.
Each type of primal dragon features a note in the margins on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a primal dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other primal spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Wisdom or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect their mastery of magic.

Denizens of the Midnight Mountains in the Darklands worship the ancient umbral dragon Ugothogo as a deity.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Young White Dragon.
The most feral and least intelligent of all the chromatic dragons, white dragons are brutish, predatory, and chiefly motivated by self-preservation. Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous—in fact, it may mean the opposite. It’s nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don’t care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking—and when the attack comes, it’s bloody and relentless.
Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon’s territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility—such as tools, trade goods, and fine food—over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they’ve decorated their homes over the years.
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age.

<|startoftext|>Describe a Zaramuun.
Zaramuuns are beings of elemental sand that hide in deserts and wastelands. They disguise themselves as massive dunes before rising up to attack living creatures. The most infamous zaramuuns kill any living creatures they find, but others simply rob their victims of all metal and stone possessions before fleeing. Although zaramuuns insist they are only reclaiming what was taken from their ancestral earth, this is simple self-delusion; most zaramuuns use their stolen goods as payment and material components to conjure fiends, for Zaramuuns were exiled from the Plane of Earth after worshipping fiends who promised to give them power over other elementals. This worship gradually transformed into servitude, and now many zaramuuns believe that if they send enough souls to their masters, they will be set free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Zebub (Accuser Devil).
Zebubs serve as Hell's messengers and spies. Their ability to share what they've seen with other creatures makes them especially useful—not only to other devils, but also to mortal conjurers. Some infernal lords unleash them in enormous, horrid swarms upon unsuspecting lands to debase flesh and land alike while collecting secrets the infernal host might later put to use. Zebubs use any opportunity to manipulate weak-willed or easily tempted mortals into serving the zebubs' whims. While arrogant and deceitful, zebubs lack the cunning and confidence of most devils, and thus their schemes often focus on satisfying self-serving or self-destructive ambitions. Zebubs form from the souls of childish and craven mortals, reshaped by the archdevil Baalzebul in the frozen, filthy wastes of Hell's seventh layer, Cocytus.
At any one time, eight archdevils rule the eight upper layers of Hell, while the deepest layer is ruled by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a unique demigod with a dedicated role in guiding the infernal machine forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city. Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries, and Belial designs new weapons for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the oldest archdevil and keeper of many secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs armies. Baalzebul is a brooding archdevil who has fallen from Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty Mephistopheles was formed from the plane of Hell itself.
Many unique and powerful devils hold positions of power in Hell. The most numerous of these are the infernal dukes, many of whom were promoted to this position from already impressive statures as pit fiends. The supreme ruler of Hell itself is Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness. Between these two tiers rule the eight archdevils—see the sidebar on the facing page.
The nine layers of Hell are the planar home of all devils, and they much prefer its tyrannically ordered environs to anywhere else in the multiverse. Yet devils can be encountered anywhere mortals can be tempted by infernal bargains or seek diabolic aid. On Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is particularly aligned with Hell. Its government is based upon Hellʼs organization, and the state church is that of Asmodeus.
Devils view daemonsʼ constant hunt for souls as a short-sighted waste of potential, and demonsʼ chaotic destruction of society and flesh as uncivilized and obnoxious, but they do not loathe their fiendish counterparts. Indeed, most devils are more than willing to take advantage of daemons and demons as they can to further their own machinations.
Stinking, sulfurous hellfire is infused with evil. Hellfire always deals a combination of fire damage and evil damage, though the specific ratio depends on the hellfire's origin. Certain types of hellfire can impose other effects on creatures as well, such as sapping their strength or memories.
While travel to and from Hell is possible with plane shift, another way to reach and traverse the infernal realms is via hellmouths, strange living portals connecting different layers or even different planes. A hellmouth takes the form of a grimacing face, distended maw, or other distressingly organic aperture, and no two share the same appearance. Most are carefully guarded, but some new or well-hidden hellmouths have yet to be discovered.
The devils presented on these pages are a small sampling of the torments Hell has to offer. Other devils, like the inquisition-focused bone devils, the cherub-faced and fly-bodied accuser devils, and the aquatic drowning devil are a few examples of these widespread immortal creatures.
The four queens of the night wield great power in the Pit. Ardad Lili is a plotter and manipulator with ambitions of ruling the heavens, while Doloras revels in suffering. Most distant is Mahathallah, watching over fate and death. Mightiest among them is Eiseth, who is assembling an army in Dis in the hopes of claiming the iron throne of Malebolge.
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little use for compassion or empathy. As such, it exists entirely within a strict hierarchy, and this order extends to its denizens. While different types of demons correspond to various sins and daemons are associated with modes of mortal death, the different types of devils exist solely to fulfill particular roles in the infernal machine. On occasion, a particular devil can transcend the role for which they were literally shaped, but this often transforms the devil physically into the type suitable for their new role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Zelekhut.
A zelekhut is a bounty hunter and executioner. The zelekhut resembles a mechanical centaur crafted from silvery metal with golden clockwork wings adorning its back. Instead of hands, the zelekhut's arms end in long, barbed chains that crackle with electricity. Whether sent by the powers of Axis or summoned by mortal authorities, the zelekhut seeks out those who continually evade justice—either through active flight, or by abusing their power and station—so as to bring justice to the multiverse's most notorious fugitives and criminals. Indeed, many a zelekhut's quarry are as famous for their ability to evade capture as for the crimes they commit.
Though the zelekhut is implacable and unrelenting in enforcing sentences, it does not pass judgments of its own or take the initiative in pursuing targets of opportunity. While hunting a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a dozen planes, the zelekhut wouldn't shift a single hoof to capture a corrupt ruler whose offenses are far greater. All zelekhuts understand that laws can and must differ from place to place, and it is not the zelekhut's job to moralize, merely to obey its rightful assignments and track down those who seek to flee their punishment.
As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons’ war against imbalance—particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos.
Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the “Convergence.” At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons — but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How—or if—this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves.
Whether the aeons serve an actual divinity, a philosophical concept, or merely a “supreme oneness” is a topic hotly debated by planar scholars. The aeons themselves are silent, referring to this being or concept as the Monad, a “condition of all.” Regardless of what the Monad actually is, there certainly exists another category of powerful aeons—the primal inevitables, each a unique demigod with its own powers and goals. Relatively few primal inevitables remain today, for nearly three-quarters of their irreplaceable kind have fallen in the endless battle with the inexorable forces of entropy.
Aeons are among the least understood of the Great Beyond’s immortal creatures, and they have a wide range of powers and abilities. Far more aeons exist than those presented here, including guardians of time like the four-armed bythos and the weirdly symmetrical theletos, which moderates the duality between freedom and fate.
To mortals, aeons sometimes seem to combine elements that are fundamentally incompatible, whether it's an aeon combining opposing concepts, or axiomites and inevitables mixing the organic with the mathematical or mechanical. Aeons see no paradox in this, but rather claim it is an expression of the underlying unity of all things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Zephyr Hawk.
Zephyr hawks drift among the currents of the Plane of Air in great flocks.
The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Some elementals, such as invisible stalkers, xorns, and salamanders, have specific cultures and personalities that elevate them beyond simple magical creatures or manifestations of living energy. These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes.
The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep.
Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities.
The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars.
Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms.
Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well.
When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange.
The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Zombie Brute.
Necromantic augmentations have granted this zombie increased size and power.
You can modify zombies with the following zombie abilities. Most zombies have one of these abilities; If you give a zombie more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics.
Disgusting Pustules (disease, necromancy) The zombie is covered in pustules that rupture when it takes any piercing damage or any critical hit. In either case, adjacent creatures are hit with vile fluid, causing them to become sickened 1 unless they succeed at a Fortitude save.
Feast (manipulate) If the zombie is adjacent to a helpless or unconscious creature, or a deceased creature that died in the past hour, the zombie can feast upon its flesh to heal itself. This restores an amount of Hit Points equal to the zombie’s level. If the creature is alive, the zombie deals damage equal to its jaws, flst, or claw damage.
Plague-Ridden (disease, necromancy) The zombie carries a plague that can create more of its own kind. This functions as the plague zombie’s zombie rot, except at stage 5, the victim rises as another of the zombie’s type, rather than a plague zombie.
Rotting Aura (aura, disease, necromancy) The zombie emits an aura of rot and disease that causes wounds to fester and turn sour. Any living creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie and is not at full Hit Points takes 1d6 damage as its wounds fester. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 6 levels the zombie has. Creatures that take a critical hit from the zombie also take this damage immediately.
Unkillable This zombie is nigh unkillable. The zombie loses its weakness to slashing and gains resistance against all damage equal to its level (minimum 3), and it gains weakness equal to twice its level (minimum 6) to critical hits. Increase the zombie’s level by 1 if you give it this ability.
To create a zombie creature, start with a zombie of the appropriate size. Then add any Strikes, Speeds, or other abilities it would gain from its shape. To create a Gargantuan zombie, begin with the zombie hulk, apply the elite adjustments, change its size to Gargantuan, and increase its reach by 5 feet.
Zombies are often created using unwholesome necromantic rituals. Among the living dead, zombies are most often used as fodder, wearing down defenses and consuming resources before more powerful undead arrive to deal the killing blow. Zombies cannot speak or really even think for themselves, but they can be commanded by other allied undead and powerful necromancers.<|endoftext|>

Feast (manipulate) If the zombie is adjacent to a helpless or unconscious creature, or a deceased creature that died in the past hour, the zombie can feast upon its flesh to heal itself. This restores an amount of Hit Points equal to the zombie’s level. If the creature is alive, the zombie deals damage equal to its jaws, flst, or claw damage.
Plague-Ridden (disease, necromancy) The zombie carries a plague that can create more of its own kind. This functions as the plague zombie’s zombie rot, except at stage 5, the victim rises as another of the zombie’s type, rather than a plague zombie.
Rotting Aura (aura, disease, necromancy) The zombie emits an aura of rot and disease that causes wounds to fester and turn sour. Any living creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie and is not at full Hit Points takes 1d6 damage as its wounds fester. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 6 levels the zombie has. Creatures that take a critical hit from the zombie also take this damage immediately.
Unkillable This zombie is nigh unkillable. The zombie loses its weakness to slashing and gains resistance against all damage equal to its level (minimum 3), and it gains weakness equal to twice its level (minimum 6) to critical hits. Increase the zombie’s level by 1 if you give it this ability.
To create a zombie creature, start with a zombie of the appropriate size. Then add any Strikes, Speeds, or other abilities it would gain from its shape. To create a Gargantuan zombie, begin with the zombie hulk, apply the elite adjustments, change its size to Gargantuan, and increase its reach by 5 feet.
Zombies are often created using unwholesome necromantic rituals. Among the living dead, zombies are most often used as fodder, wearing down defenses and consuming resources before more powerful undead arrive to deal the killing blow. Zombies cannot speak or really even think for themselves, but they can be commanded by other allied undead and powerful necromancers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Describe a Zomok.
Mighty plant-dragons, zomoks prowl the woodlands, defending their homes from destructive forces while healing and restoring the woods following natural disasters and ravaging intruders. Zomoks vary in appearance with the seasons, growing verdant green in the spring and summer, changing to autumnal colors in the fall, and decaying to brown in winter. While zomoks can and often do swallow their foes, they have no real need to eat. Any creature they gulp down is typically left behind as a mangled corpse the next time the zomok travels via their Forest Step ability. Zomoks reach 35 to 40 feet in length and weigh 30 tons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Zrukbat.
Zrukbats resemble long-limbed bats with gangly wings, which make them clumsy fliers. Instead, these reclusive fey prefer to crawl along surfaces using the hooked talons on the tips of their wings and feet. Their somewhat humanoid faces feature bulging black eyes, dark fur, and pointed fangs, shocking—if not terrifying—those who get a glimpse of them scuttling along a roof or peeping out from under an eave. Sensitive creatures, zrukbats quickly learn that their appearance triggers negative reactions, yet they prefer to live in urban settlements, observing busy streets and houses from inconspicuous locations.
Zrukbats hide in plain sight using their shapeshifting abilities to mimic a broad repertoire of objects. Despite their intelligence, they fundamentally don't understand others' reasoning and often make foolish mistakes in their disguises. For example, one might shapeshift into a lit lantern in an otherwise abandoned house, misjudge the pattern of roof ornaments and become an out-of-place spire, or disguise themself as smoke in an unlit chimney.
Due to their fearsome appearance and predisposition to conceal themselves, zrukbats are associated with ghosts and other supernatural phenomena. This affiliation isn't wholly earned; as long as zrukbats feel they've gone unnoticed, they remain generally peaceful. When their obsessive secrecy fails, they devolve into extremely volatile, dangerous creatures. Once spotted, zrukbats fly into a rage if anyone utters even a casual suspicion regarding their presence. In areas known to harbor zrukbats, superstition forbids speaking aloud of curious phenomena, lest they take offense and attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Zuipnyrn (Moon Mole).
This spectacularly odd creature appears every now and again in various traveling circuses around the Inner Sea. Although carnival barkers make any number of claims about this strange being’s origins, the so-called “moon mole” is in fact an alien creature called a zuipnyrn, hailing from a distant planet beyond Golarion’s star system.
In their infancy, zuipnyrns are spherical and furry, with few features other than a single eye stalk and a round, toothless feeding hole. A zuipnyrn’s body is particularly soft and malleable, allowing it to withstand falls and other hazards. Its eye stalk has the ability to produce a blinding burst of light as a defensive measure, which allows a zuipnyrn just enough time to escape in times of danger. Even more incredibly, a zuipnyrn can emit a hypnotic aura from its eye to entrance those around it—an ability it uses to avoid conflict and to persuade bystanders into helping it escape perilous situations. As they age and grow, zuipnyrns adapt to their environment by growing additional limbs, sprouting additional sensory organs, developing gills, or otherwise altering their anatomy to suit the area.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describe a Zyss Serpentfolk.
Even the least among zyss serpentfolk consider themselves greater than any mammal. Their magical abilities, most notably their telepathy, are all the reason they need to hold this view. And it's true enough that the instinctual skill and magic of any zyss is enough to best the average human.
Today, the central realm of the Darklands retains the old name of the serpentfolk empire that once dominated this region—Sekamina. This name is also the source of the serpentfolk’s Aklo title, sekmin, which they are often called in ancient texts. Sekamina itself retains very little of the serpentfolk’s legacy, its mantle of rule having passed on to others like drow, ghouls, gugs, and deep gnomes. Yet in remote reaches of this dangerous realm, the ruins of serpentfolk cities still stand. Within, a great many serpentfolk sleep in torpor in secluded vaults, with only a few cells awake to enact their schemes. In addition, a small number of serpentfolk settlements dot Golarion’s surface, most of them in humid, remote jungles, far-flung islands, or caverns close to the surface. It’s rare for such a settlement to number more than a few dozen serpentfolk. They rely primarily on slaves to build their power bases, to defend them, and to perform essentially all the practical functions of their society. This includes providing food, crafting goods, and tending to the serpentfolk’s every need.
Zyss serpentfolk are megalomaniacal geniuses with dreams of returning to their place of dominance, though modern serpentfolk have few means of accomplishing this goal. Many of their plans hinge on resurrecting Ydersius, their decapitated god. His headless body still thrashes about, mindless, in the Darklands, waiting to be reunited with his lost skull. Serpentfolk numbers are so small that reclaiming their dominance seems a distant dream, especially since their reproduction is slow. Though a parent can birth a dozen young at once, the gestation period lasts up to a decade, and the likelihood that even one will be zyss is low. There’s no telling whether a child will be zyss or aapoph, regardless of parentage. A coveted zyss child is just as likely to arise from aapoph parents as from two zyss, and every serpentfolk colony has someone in charge of sorting the young, identifying the earliest signs of intelligence in them.
Though the number of zyss is small in serpentfolk colonies, bringing in more zyss isn’t necessarily desirable. A serpentfolk conclave with just a few zyss is functional, but one with a large number becomes fractious. Cults and societies form, all pursuing their own passions and politics, with scheming and backstabbing running rampant. A powerful priest may be able to bring other zyss to heel, but many zyss question why a priest should be in charge if their god is dead. Zyss thrive on selfish desires for hedonistic pleasure and adulation. They feel no love for others, even their offspring. Thriving on decadence, they crave receiving expensive gifts, gorging themselves on massive meals, and pursing arts such as music, poetry, or sculpture. Even more academic hobbies, like the study of magic or warfare, take an artistic bent, like carefully designing colorful illusions or memorizing epic poems about renowned wars. Each zyss believes themself to have more refined tastes than their peers.
Some serpentfolk might have entirely different innate spells. These alternative spells are typically illusions, enchantments, or divinations like dream message, enthrall, glibness, invisibility, mindlink, mind probe, mind reading, mislead, phantom pain, or zealous conviction. Aapoph serpentfolk lack innate spells.
Ydersius was defeated by an Azlanti heroine named Savith in the era before Earthfall, and now the so-called Headless King's body prowls aimlessly in the Darklands. That the decapitated god's clerics still gain power from worship points to Ydersius's tenacity and continued existence, after a fashion. Those who seek to recover his skull and return it to his body hope that doing so will restore both him and the sekmin civilization to their full power.
The war between the humans of ancient Azlant and the serpentfolk of Sekamina waged on for years. The serpentfolk's defeat threw their society into chaos and undermined their conviction that they would continue to rule simply because they had done so for eons. For millennia, serpentfolk have remained in hiding in their underground fortresses, but many feel it is time to rise again!<|endoftext|>
